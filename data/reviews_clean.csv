15290,50207226,-476678969,2023-11-01,34476334,Carrie-Anne,"Overall it was a good stay and everything was as described. There was plenty of space and the apartment itself was clean. <br/>It was  difficult walking my dog in the area because the particular block where it's located was covered in a unusual (unusual in that there is always some trash on the ground in any city, but this was far more than expected) amount of trash and broken glass everywhere. The host was very responsive which was great, but a couple of times it was clear that she was talking about another unit when I asked her questions."
16349,52359404,2094032510,2022-06-27,129617138,Desiree,This quiet and tranquil home is perfect for a home filled getaway in the beautiful mountains of Albany!!! Great comfort in this three bedroom home where you can eat out or cook in!  It’s so perfect!!!  I had one question and the host got back to me immediately!  What a pleasurable and comfortable stay!  It felt like home…
19931,-1197600229,1214539539,2023-06-11,60552249,Courtney,"Rabia's apartment was fantastic and just as described. She provided us with great recommendations for restaurants nearby and clear instructions for entry and parking. The apartment was charming, clean and comfy. We would definitely stay again when back in Albany."
15488,50890336,-1304290700,2021-08-26,45354,Noble,"The place was quite nice and very lovely. Easy to use lockbox. Easy walk up, 1 flight. Right next to great restaurants and bars. Definitely located in a hip area."

16398,52359404,87579284,2023-10-15,262778822,Jacquelin,"This is a great stay. It is a lovely and exceptionally clean home with windows throughout to make it bright and cheery and yet it is brilliantly staged with blackout curtains in all the bedrooms to make sleeping peaceful. It is an older  home that has been furnished and decorated thoughtfully to make it comfortable and functional. There were plenty of clean white towels and the white bedding let's you know it's all freshly laundered. There is driveway parking,  and it is a convenient location to multiple universities and Albany area transit. Having an upstairs neighbor does come with some noise, but we would not hesitate to stay here again. The host was so responsive when we had questions and it was just overall a great stay."
16656,52619545,-226803316,2021-12-18,135444499,Barb,This was a good one night stay at Diana’s place. The space was perfect for us to visit with our daughter after grabbing some local vegan food Little Anthony’s. We appreciate being able to have our dogs along and had space for the crates where they are used to sleeping. The area has sidewalks and we walked the dogs while we enjoyed the Christmas decorations throughout the neighborhood.

9729,33558235,449782374,2019-05-07,182252868,Mary Ann,"Earl's place is fabulous! Clean, architecturally interesting, in a cool, funky neighborhood and with more amenities than I have ever seen. He is very quick to communicate and was very accommodating when I showed up early and confused my check-out date! Even though there is not guaranteed assigned parking, we had no problems finding a spot right in front of the house. Overall, this was truly one of THE best airbnb experiences that I have had."

20681,-553884809,746997289,2023-02-27,7914282,Arian,"I travel to Albany, NY for work regularly and have stayed in many hotels and rentals. This is my second time staying in one of Scott’s air bnbs and I am once again very impressed. Everything was brand new, renovated, and squeaky clean. Scott was once again very friendly and easy to deal with. There’s a washer and dryer which was awesome. Most places I’ve stayed in around Albany didn’t have access to that amenity. There’s a great little cafe just up the block that I walked to. Parking on the street was really easy (just read signs.) I’ll most definitely return to this location for future trips."
9367,32993402,491704697,2019-07-20,208751174,Kim,The location for events at Times Union Center was perfect. We were able to walk. The host was very responsive.

Stayed for 5 days and walked to dinner, with several great options. And central to drive to anywhere within few miles. Dan made it easy and was a great host with anything we needed. Came by and shoveled the snow for us. Awesome place just sad I couldn’t stay longer.   Highly recommended."

I asked Earl  when I did the reservation we needed to get in the apartment at 12 Noon,  but unfortunately when we arrived to the building he didn’t let us in till 4:30 PM. He allowed us to drop off the luggage in the boiler room but he asked  is to leave the building. It was raining and we didn’t have a place to go.<br/>The smoke alarms were not there,"

17273,53567589,-1700160717,2022-08-18,393269563,Matt,"This is a great place to stay in the Albany NY area. Brian is an amazing host who communicates with you before and during your stay to make sure the whole process is seamless and straightforward. The check in and out process couldn’t have been easier and the rental itself is accurate with the pictures. It is a very nice place to stay with a location offering many places to eat, drink, and shop all within walking distance."

6951,25549565,4700612,2021-11-27,35011062,Jenny,"Perfect space to stay in while visiting local family. It’s a tiny space, but find for 2 people and our dog. Full of light, clean, and well maintained. Small fridge is pretty powerful- so don’t turn setting too low or all your food will freeze! 2 hour street parking can be a pain when it’s not a holiday or weekend, but there are always spots in the park. Convenient to food, parks, highways. The hosts live right upstairs and although you can hear “movement” upstairs, it wasn’t disruptive or loud. The entrance is a shared downstairs entry that leads up set of stairs into their living space, so just don’t let your pets off leash when you’re heading out through the entry way!  Hosts are very friendly and quickly responsive. Would stay there again!"
7779,28519423,1668474332,2023-09-04,359574214,Ibn,Great house and person
13488,45313545,297632060,2023-01-16,12530131,Kate,"Great location and easy check-in. Kori was easy to communicate with and changed around construction that started after we arrived in order to work with our schedule, which we really appreciated. As others have noted, this is the first floor of an older house so you do hear upstairs neighbors coming and going -- it didn't bother us (and we were out and about most days anyway) but worth noting if you have a particular need for quiet. Kitchen is spacious and the bed is comfortable!"
8973,29605579,426598853,2019-03-21,173394146,Brett,"Terra’s place was outstanding sparkling clean! She was also very easy to talk and responded very fast! The apartment was spacious, comfy and again, very clean. My wife was really impressed by the big bathroom and very much enjoyed the memory foam bed. We will definitely be booking Terra’s place again the next time we hit up the Albany area."
14198,47334913,-642140063,2022-08-07,19723335,Duncan,"Lovely clean apartment with huge gas stove (if you do wish to cook). The outside, especially the back, doesn't do it justice inside. A really comfortable place to stay with great communication from Allen. Recommended"

It's also close to the restaurants and bars on Lark Street.  And it's in a cool early-20th-century building with a neat old elevator. The apartment looks nice, is clean, has all the listed amenities, and has an amazing view and lots of sunlight. The host responded quickly to questions, and was very flexible about my checkout time.<br/>However, the building next door was being renovated while I was there, and there was construction noise every day -- including loud noise on Saturday and Sunday starting around 10am.  In fact, one day there was loud construction noise, followed by a parade with marching bands, followed by a 3-hour political protest! So maybe not the best apartment for sleeping late, or for getting work done, if those are important to you.<br/>One other issue: The radiator in the living room worked OK, but the one in the bedroom didn't give much heat."

My number one frustrating thing is parking, but here, parking was not difficult to find. And it’s also close to my favorite local pizza shop. The only thing is it does get chilly inside sometimes."

Fridge & microwave, good internet, work space with desk. <br/> On a winter weekend with temps in the 30s & low 40s, it was  a little chilly in the room. Space heater available, but not large enough to compensate for little or nothing from radiators. <br/>Parking was as promised (""plenty on the street nearby"") Friday & Saturday, but a nightmare on Sunday, when only residents are allowed to park for more than 2 hours on weekdays. And finding a space Sunday night was a only by luck within a 6 block area. You're good if it's only a weekend. Weekdays, no."

Donna herself was very kind and welcoming, and though minimal, it’s exactly what you’re paying for: comfortable and straightforward. Expect loud barking and calling after a dog in the morning, neighborhood things like that. But overall, a good value and I recommend staying here if you need a place for a short-term trip."

503,3820211,426583077,2019-03-21,41109480,Sarah,"Listing was just as described. Check-in and access to the building were easy. Host communicated everything the day of check-in. Had all your basic amenities and was perfect for a night stay! It’s right on a main road & close to quite a few bars, which are open LATE, so it can get noisy. Also the building has pretty thin walls. Could hear neighbors laughter & music until pretty late into the night. There must be some sort of shared vent system (old building) because the whole bedroom smelled pretty herby/skunky when we got back from our concert. It wasn’t an issue for us, but I know some people are sensitive or take issue with that type of activity. Great location. Really close to late night pizza, cafes, and plenty of bars and restaurants. Washington park is super close by which is nice to walk through. Empire plaza is within walking distance. All in all it was definitely an acceptable stay for us!"

The apartment also had a washer/dryer which helped when staying for a week. The location is close to the Egg and the capital.  Parking was generally okay, but some nights I had to park several streets away.  Overall, great value and a clean space that is in downtown Albany."

Brian has been the absolute best host I've had to date....he proactively checked in with me to make sure all was well....it was!  😀   He also responded timely.  My one recommendation to anyone renting this place is to plan parking at the Trinity Church parking lot right on Lark street.  It's less than two blocks from the place.  Only $6 for 10 hours....very reasonable.   I would stay here again if I'm in the area.

The bungalow's restoration was clearly a labor of love and the results are straight out of a magazine. It was a super serene space to stay while a family member was at Albany Medical Center. I'd come back for a weekend getaway in a heartbeat--and might not leave the bungalow! The host was super communicative and responded quickly when I had questions."

There are plenty of restaurants in walking distance.  The check in instructions were easy and understandable.  The free parking spot in the back was awesome.   We stayed in February so it was a cold time of year and if you needed an extra blanket, there were some you could use.  <br/>As stated in the description, the walls are paper thin, but all the quiet hours are respected.  <br/>We didn't use the kitchen except to put drinks in the fridge.  The TV did do a lot of buffering so it was hard to watch a show on Amazon.   <br/>We would stay here again the next time we have to come to Albany.  It was a great place for the price!!"

We came in and out quickly as we only needed a place to sleep for one night, but the value was incomparable and the space is very cute and cozy. The beds are extremely comfortable, every amenity was well thought out to provide the utmost convenience to their guests. As a superhost myself, I absolutely appreciated the thought and care that went into Earl’s space and hosting style. He automated everything so that the check in process was seamless, and the room felt very secure with its private entrance. Thanks for everything!"

Earl was extremely responsive and helped me through the check in which I was a bit confused about. I’d like to note for anyone looking to stay hers that the “August” app is not needed.<br/>The area of the Air BnB was not the best neighborhood. I am from New York City do it was extremely apparent to me that the bnb was in the hood. However, I did feel safe in the air bnb itself in comparison to the area it was in. <br/>My friend and I stayed for about 5 days to a few more towels would’ve been nice. The WiFi was a bit spotty and there were a couple insects but it was an affordable studio in the basement so it didn’t come as a shock.<br/>Overall, the bed was amazing and the air bnb itself was cozy. It was worth the price."

A note for the more - rubenesque - travelers… the shower wall opening make it a tad difficult to get in and out of. I don’t think the door swung out but I didn’t want to pull too hard.  Bed could sleep two cozily. The place was immaculate and spacious. Pictures are accurate. I’ve put this on my list of favorites.

First of all, the apartment is clean and simple. There’s not a lot of furniture, but the bed is comfortable and firm, the kitchen has everything one person might need, the bathroom was tiny, but clean with plenty of hot water. The neighborhood is quiet. The entrance is around the back, walking through a grassy area on a wood walkway. <br/>The apartment isn’t really furnished like a person’s own apartment, but it has everything you need for a stay, and it is a very good value. I like it far more than a motel room. <br/>There are a couple places to eat around a 10 minute walk away across from St Peter’s Hospital, but it isn’t walkable to a real commercial area. If you don’t mind buses, there is bus service a block away along New Scotland Ave that can get you to a lot more services. <br/>Like I said, I expect I’ll stay there again. Need I say more?"

4738,20519807,502525892,2019-08-04,82740504,John,"A great place for mid- to long-term stays. I was there for 2+ months for a summer internship. The house was always kept very clean, and all of the amenities are basically brand new. It's a shared-use house (5 individually rented bedrooms sharing 2 bathrooms/showers, 1 dining area and kitchen, and laundry area) but all of the residents I came across were very polite, and Michael does  a good job of laying out ground rules that keep everyone from getting in each other's way.  Although Michael and Flerida don't live on the property, Michael is there at least once a week to clean and is otherwise available by phone basically 24/7 to address any problems and always responded to any of my questions within minutes. Location is a very quiet neighborhood, but is nearby to restaurants, shops, and stops for several different bus routes. Overall a great place for anyone looking to stay in Albany for a week up to a few months."

The apartment was clean and comfortable and Diana offered a lot of amenities like coffee, creamer, water and even shampoo and conditioner. The listing should mention that the apartment is on the 2nd floor. No fault of Diana’s but it was very loud in the area at 3 a.m. with parties that kept us awake. The two off street parking spots and easy check in was great. Thank you Diana."

In my view, a perfect place to stay over for the single traveler. I had my kids with me, and although they were OK sleeping on the pull out sofa bed, I don't think an adult would be."

I'm not sure if there was a pan, I ate lots of take out and used my own utensils because I travel that much.<br/>It felt as if I were visiting my grandparents.

Also, be prepared to bring anything you need for cooking (apart from pots and pans). There aren't any spices, etc.  The shower was nice and hot!  We really liked the fluffy comforters and pillows.

The home is spacious and everything was nice and clean when we arrived. There were some nice amenities, including plenty of towels -- and the kitchen was stocked with basics for our use like coffee, tea, cream and sugar.<br/>We happened to get lucky with the weather which allowed us to take advantage of the deck with creek view, which was a welcome respite from what's been a tough winter.<br/>The bedrooms were all comfortable and nicely appointed with classic furnishings. <br/>The home is also in a great location, right in the middle of Albany and easily accessible to just about anything in the city.<br/>We'd definitely stay here again next time we take the whole clan to Albany."

Adam's place felt salubrious in that in a Edgar Cayce way. I enjoyed three meals high in flavor and spice and low in sodium, perfect for a man under treatment for high blood pressure. I found myself picking up ideas for simple, breezy, inexpensive meals low in sodium. His Turkish Scrambled Eggs might cure a wide range of maladies.<br/>My room was beautiful in monastic simplicity and I found myself taking more rest than I had planned. I found books to read and I slept a sleep of musey dreams, waking filled with ideas for my writing. The cafe on the first floor, drinking vibrant coffee, gave me a place to put my musings into words.<br/>I feel healthier, healed of some malady of which I know not the name."

BUT Adam shall not be allowed to host anyone at his place! Adam house is insalubrious and present a real HEALTH HAZARD!!! When I booked a night over Adam sent me a message recalling among other things that his place did not have AC and that the bathroom and Kitchen were « dirty ». Because of his message I thought Adam was acting in good faith. I double checked the pics and found out that his place was looking maybe a bit dusty but not DIRTY. But here is the real reason why Adam sent me  this message: as soon as I contacted airbnb to get a partial refund or to (at least) make sure that no one else will ever sleep in such hazardous place, Airbnb told me: Sorry you agreed to the flat « condition » so we can’t do anything to help you! I never agreed the flat condition as the pics do not reflect the reality (even a dog would not sleep there). SHAME ON YOU AIRBNB!<br/>Stay safe, stay away"

The only thing that was bothersome were the moths flying around as well as the paper thin walls, you could hear the other people very clearly but they did stop around 10-11 Pm."

They provided us another apt for a few days due to the leakage in bathroom. However the apt is very old and needs a lot of work before it can be rented it again.  The rugs need to be washed.

Very clean and in an ideal location, right across from beautiful park for walking and a short walk away from local restaurants with cute places for drinks as well. The room was well prepped to enjoy from board games/cards, TV entertainment options through Roku, little kitchenette if needed with complimentary water/coffee/creamers and even complimentary shampoo/conditioner/body wash which is always a bonus. The communication was fantastic as I needed help with check into the room but not to fault Lloyd it was the smart lock malfunctioning but with one call it was fixed within 2 minutes.

He popped in in person to say hello which was very nice of him. He was very quick to come by when there was a problem with the studio as well. <br/>The amenities are quite basic with the kitchen and the sleeping area joined together. The bathroom is just outside the studio, but that was never an issue as I never bumped into other people. <br/>Just to note: there is a lack of sunlight due to this being kinda half on the lower ground floor. <br/>But the price and the location can't be beat. Thank you for your hospitality Gregg! "

Upon checking in. We immediately smelled what smelled like cigarettes smoke. We would advise that an air purifier is installed to help with this issue. going forward as some people could be very very sensitive to cigarette smell, we have an issue of not having enough soap, toilet paper and shampoo however, this was rectified very very quickly, and the host made accommodations for us to help resolve this, that was appreciated. The two window air seas did allow for enough cooling to keep the location comfortable. It did look like the host was going through a remodel as paint splatter was in the kitchen sink and on floors, and in some other areas, but that was not a huge issue for us. overall we would give us location anywhere between 3.5 and 3.75 stars as an overall location.."

Adem was very responsive if ever I had any questions for him and the place was very clean. I would say that it is well-suited for both long-term and short-term visits (for example the unit has a washing machine and drying rack), but if you are staying long-term I would recommend bringing a couple cooking items (like a frying pan and spatula) as the available items are not of the best quality and some things are missing (such as a baking tray). With that said, I was still able to make  due and it’s right above Noho Pizza and near other restaurants so it’s the perfect location for someone who doesn’t usually cook. Overall, I would recommend staying here! It has everything you need for a comfortable stay."

He would message me back almost instantly and his check in directions were the most detailed and helpful I have ever received.  The location of the Loft apartment was so great as we walked to almost anywhere we went.  If you are going to an event at Times Union this is the perfect spot as it's a 3 minute walk away.  Tons of great bars and restaurants within a 8 minute walk and Lark St. is an easy 20 minute walk.  The Loft was incredibly clean.  So many small but great amenities such as coffee, shampoo, conditioner, soap, cereal, pantry food items.  Highest recommendation for Earl and the space!!!"

The hot tub was difficult to get the jets going but Diana had quick responses to the concerns and it was able to be resolved! The place is super cozy, and definitely a great place for a getaway. However, the only issue we had was the cleanliness of the kitchen. We planned to cook most of the nights but had to Uber eats food instead bc the kitchen utensils, pots & pans had stains or seemed unclean from the previous stay. The soap was watered down so it was difficult to even clean, and there were no pods for the dishwasher. Only thing that was a little upsetting from the stay"

The apartment itself is cute and very homey; felt right at home. It was very spacious except for the bathroom. The area itself is not the safest neighborhood. <br/>My only complaint about the apartment is hot water! The water was never hot, no matter how long you keep it running. The most the water ever got was lukewarm, in the entire apartment."

The apartment is beautiful, it's extremely clean, has nice amenities, and it centrally located to all the great spots in downtown Albany (walkable).  We stayed over on a Saturday night in the summer, which did lend to a lot of outside noise.  I had forgotten how rambunctious people can get in the summer time.... the apartment is ground level so we were woken up around 1am to a lot of people very noisily walking by, and it sounded like someone was having an outdoor party next to the building.  A couple of earplugs solved the problem for me, but my fiance didn't get much sleep.  This isn't unusual for a weekend in a city, so just be aware of when you are visiting and prep accordingly.  I still gave the apartment 5 stars because this was nothing within the host's control.  Everything provided by Terra was excellent and as described."

Crystal left clear, written instructions for things like logging into wi-fi and locking the front door; and provided numerous new toiletries for my stay (more than expected!). I had a very enjoyable and peaceful stay here and would definitely recommend booking with Crystal again for anyone looking to stay in Albany. (As a notice to some, however, one must walk up stairs since the room is on the second floor.) Crystal arranged for me to park my car for free on the street. The neighborhood looked safe."

6798,25549565,577649363,2019-12-15,295183617,Jan,"I visited the Albany area on my own for business purposes. I needed a place to stay for a few days that would allow me to walk to shops and museums during my free time (since I didn't plan on renting a car).  This was perfect for that.  When it got dark, I ubered because I was on my own but had no problems finding a driver.     <br/>The place had plenty of space for me. Check-in was easy and I found the private entrance convenient.    The bed was very comfy, and the bathroom was cozy on cold mornings.  I had my own toiletries but liked knowing that some products were available if needed.  The hair dryer came in handy, and I had no issues with the water pressure in the shower.  <br/>I especially liked the information provided by the hosts about area restaurants and attractions.  They even had some directions up on the wall to help you head the right way when you ventured out.  It was a short walk to the Iron Gate Cafe, a yummy breakfast spot in a historic building.  It's near the Albany Institute of Art--definitely worth a visit if you're into museums.  <br/>A coffee maker was provided along with coffee and sugar.  The only thing that could have made the visit even better was cream of some kind (maybe nondairy powder if that's easiest).  Cups, dishes, and silverware were available to use as needed.  While most mornings I went out for coffee and breakfast, I had at least one morning where I stayed in, so the coffee maker was a lifesaver. <br/>One of the reasons for this Five Start Review is responsiveness.  As we got closer to the reservation, I messaged Janet with lots of questions, and she always responded within an hour or two.  I appreciated that she got back to me almost immediately when I contacted her with questions during the stay.   Since parking is a challenge on this street, I definitely recommend this for visitors who plan to walk to uber around town. However, I believe the hosts mentioned that there is paid parking in the area for those who need it.  <br/>This was a great visit.  Thanks again!"
283,3820211,24371260,2014-12-27,23790695,Caitlin,"We had a great visit! Terra was very welcoming and responsive to our needs prior to and during the visit.

They are very responsive and were able to make quick fixes for small things that came up during my stay. Very nice people! The house was very clean and the other guests respectful and quiet. However, I am a light sleeper, so I did get woken up a couple of times because the bedroom is in a basement meaning  you will naturally hear noises from the kitchen/bathroom. Location was nice for my meetings at the downtown SUNY campus (bus/walking), though I did not feel comfortable at night walking alone (taking uber is fine). The provided workspace is awesome, super big desk and comfortable chair."

The kitchen is so clean you would think you are there by yourself!  There was also a frig in my room.  I  saw other people at different times and they all smiled when they said “Hello.” I found the place to be quiet and peaceful. <br/>The neighborhood is fun to walk around, with interesting  houses and gardens and two free libraries. If you’re hungry, the block of New Scotland between Ontario and Quail is full of restaurants and it’s an easy walk.  <br/>Guests are encouraged to do their part to keep the place neat and clean and it really makes a difference.  It’s a very pleasant place."

8268,28722270,-2068784228,2022-02-28,329157210,Chris,Very nice place but very poor check in communication. Impersonal with huge automatic chain messages beforehand. Yet when we reached out about not being able to get in the building we were not responded to until 2 hours after we arrived and were waiting in the parking lot. Locks controlled by code that did not work until 6 even though we confirmed that we would would check in at 4 before hand. Very clearly not the “small business” he claims when asking to only leave 5 star reviews.

As we only stayed one night I can’t comment on the local amenities, however the apartment was perfect for us and had everything we needed for our stay. It is lovely and spacious with a great view of the park. The fully equipped kitchen meant we could cook an evening meal and the coffee machine was a real bonus.

When my son and I walked into the place we were shocked at how big it was! And how beautiful. The pictures on Airbnb do not do it justice. There were two bedrooms with comfortable beds, a nice big kitchen. And there is a porch in back with a backyard!<br/>I can't vouch for what it's like during the week, because we were there for a weekend, but parking was amazing. Every time we found parking right in front of the house.<br/>My son and I felt safe in the neighborhood, even at night when we walked home from the empire center. We could not believe what a good deal we got.<br/>I'm also very happy that we got to meet Johnny. He was a very nice guy and helpful. My son who is nine, and a very good judge of character, said ""Johnny has a great vibe!""<br/>I agree, anyone can tell that he is a good soul.<br/>If I ever have occasion to stay in Albany again, this is where I will try to stay."

11811,40491172,645797140,2020-08-02,68724452,Estella,"I booked this airbnb from July 19-Aug. 2, 2020. This airbnb was overall clean and the host was very responsive to my outreach and requests. The apartment was newly renovated and the pictures provided an accurate description of all that it has to offer. The kitchen area had operational stainless steel appliances and the bathroom was newly renovated. I was there during a heatwave and the air conditioners work very well. The king-sized bed in the main bedroom was very comfortable, but the single beds in the second bedroom were not as comfortable. There is off-street parking and the apartment is located close to everything in Albany. Despite this favorable review, I took a loss and cut my stay short. Why? To explain, the airbnb is locatd in an older two-family structure for which the apartment had been recently renovated. When renovated, the contractors failed to seal off entry points and open gaps between new and old material. These openings subsequently made for easy entry by, yes rodents. I had multiple encounters with mice, which made my stay very uncomfortable. I even took a loss and left the apartment before my full time because it was so uncomfortable. I encouraged the host to have a contractor seal these entry points to prevent this problem in the future. I'm confident that once this issue is addressed, future occupants will not have this experience."

Good value compared to the hotels in the area and very close to a ton of walking attractions. Would recommend.

Brand new HUGE tv (like 80 inches), comfortable beds with soft linens, clean bathrooms complete with 5 different body washes to choose from, TV’s in each bedroom, private area in backyard to hang out, new appliances in kitchen — it literally has everything you can think of. By far my favorite Airbnb I have stayed in. We booked this place last minute on our drive up to albany because our hotel cancelled our reservation and Peter responded quickly and saved the day. Highly recommend staying here if you are going to a show at SPAC in Saratoga. The Uber is like 30-35 minutes to the venue, but you can’t beat the house. Also the bagel place Common Ground is right around the corner and is incredible. We grabbed breakfast there on our way out of town and I got a great bagel and cold brew for $6"

Nic and Liz were absolutely wonderful! I only got to interact with Nic when I first arrived but he was warm and inviting and let me settle in on my own. I had the pleasure of talking to Liz for a while one morning and she was great--very friendly, and open and willing to talk to about anything. They have a cute puppy named Bella who wants nothing more than to be your friend. Overall I greatly enjoyed my stay. The room was clean and comfortable and very cute and I would recommend anyone coming to albany to stay with Nic and Liz!! "

The kitchen was well stocked with pots, pans, spices, etc. Brian was responsive to any questions we had and brought extra towels when we needed them. The apartment was very spacious and worked well for our family of four. However, the listing is described as an entire house, but there are people living upstairs who were not always quiet. Additionally, the listing says it is in a quiet neighborhood. The street itself was relatively quiet, but one block away from a very busy city street with lots of traffic noise, sirens, etc."

I can understand the frustration of finding a place on where to stay. I highlighted Ed's place in a pros and cons list to make it easier as to why you should stay here. <br/>PROs:<br/>- Actually a 7-8 minute walk to AMC. A lot of places on AirBNB will say it's a 10-minute walk, and they certainly were not a 10-minute walk. Also, Ed's place is safe to walk to and from AMC as it's on the main road and is well lit. <br/>- Ample street parking<br/>- Super clean<br/>- Quiet<br/>- Two little dogs which are super playful. Don't worry about the noise, as I didn't even hear them the entire time. <br/>CONS:<br/>- None"

The location is fantastic - a quick Lyft or walk to local bars and restaurants, central to many great areas in Albany. Most of the buildings on this block are historic and full of character. We would definitely stay in this or other properties owned by Farah and Daniel. <br/>The living room is spacious and comfortable with plush sofas. The large TV and Fire Stick let us watch anything we desired. Wifi was fast. The only drawback was during rain when the basement unit air sometimes felt stuffy and needed ventilation to let fresh air in. <br/>The kitchen wasn't huge but had just about everything we need to cook several meals a day. Plenty of counter, cupboard and fridge space. The bathroom had everything needed and a large tub/shower. <br/>The single bedroom was spacious, with a large bed with good firmness and memory foam. Plenty of closet space and a small desk to work from. A lovely intimate bedroom. <br/>This space was perfect as our Albany HQ!"

The value of one star stems from the fact that I booked the place for a month and the value for the area is quite good however, circumstances changed for my trip and I left after one week. Didn't ask for a partial refund did not expect a refund but wow how is that for the day and age we live in - very disappointing to say the least in the human condition. I know it's not easy dealing with renters and I do sympathise with what owners have to deal with. Just saying...."

The nearby restaurants and cafes also came in very handy. Parking initially was a concern, but the nearby side street almost always has parking available on it, with the pay time for parking only going until 5pm on weekdays. Overall, very pleased with the location and the amenities it provided."

12840,44180048,-1250492720,2022-05-22,53351648,Rafael,the bed is way too soft.  it was uncomfortable.   you can also hear conversations through the wall and also from anyone talking on the street which woke me up three times. the neighborhood is gentrifying so within one two blocks it looks scary and feels unsafe.  the host is extremely responsive.  the location was great for me as I had an event to attend across the street in the park. I don't know if l would stay  here again if i didnt have. an event acrosss the street . the host provided long unnecessary parking instructions which only applied to guests staying Monday to Friday.  there is free parking on the weekends. My stay was on a Saturday for one night.

I could not have asked for a better host. <br/>The overall experience and home was a home away from home. This also helped me transition to the neighborhood and also allowed me to see the working environment while transitioning from the city to Albany . I would for sure book this home again because I had a superb experience!!! <br/>Thanks David for an elaborate customer service and for being kind. <br/>For the future customers please do look anywhere else but here.<br/>- Finally destination

1261,8035768,137152284,2017-03-13,2201411,Simon,John's place is a good spot if you don't need to be in the heart of downtown Albany but within easy reach of the city in a safe and convenient neighbourhood - one of the city's best restaurants is a quick walk away and there are good cafes nearby too. The front room is large and comfortable but you will get some noise from main street traffic. I didn't see much of John - which was fine - and when I did he was pleasant to interact with. Happy to recommend.

Its located in the last building on the street, then there is a major highway between you and the river. Noise was no more or less  what you would expect from a city location.<br/>Pros:<br/>-convient location<br/>- easy parking<br/>- Earl was overall helpful<br/>- place was overall comfortable and nice<br/>Cons:<br/>-biggest con: the freaking lock on the front door is the most finicky thing and the host knows about it, and hasnt fixed it. The introductory email talks about how you cant over turn the lock or it binds up. My girlfriend got locked out for 10 minutes fighting the lock. My frustration is that its a known problem that hasnt been fixed. <br/>- second con was that there were no traahbags in the cans upon arrival. Not a big deal, just a note."

Nothing to say but great things about the host (Sean) and the apartment.<br/>The apartment was incredibly easy to find and is located in a very safe part of town. The apartment was meticulously cleaned and was adequately furnished. The living room and bedroom are especially spacious.  Many places (Capitol, Museum, Several restaurants - all of which we visited) are walkable as the apartment is located downtown in the heart of Albany. Virtually no disturbances throughout the night and in the daytime.<br/>Sean himself was always reachable and eager to help. The water pressure in the shower was low and we contacted Sean who then sent a plumber the very next day. He checked first with us to make sure that time and day was amenable for us to ensure our comfort. Have already sent this place to friends who are considering coming up to Albany. I trust that they will have as wonderful as time as we did! <br/>Perfect stay."

We just had a couple of questions and she was the nicest. Everything went without a hitch. The area is very quiet, it is across the street from the executive mansion, but we felt really safe. We were out at night and also at five in the morning on a Sunday, which was really quiet, but we didn't have any issues. The place itself has everything you need, very comfortable, and very spacious. We were there for the Hudson Mohawk River marathon, location is perfect. We were about 10 minutes walk from the expo, and 15 minutes from the finish and the buses to the start. We were also about 15 minutes away, walking, to the restaurants and bars, so it was quite convenient. I was very happy that the area and the apartment until four so quiet as I needed sleep before the marathon, everything was amazing. Thank you Molly!"

You can tell he takes pride in providing the best possible experience to his guests. <br/>His place is very updated and extremely clean. The location was peaceful yet very accessible to downtown as well.<br/>Check-in is a streamlined process that answers all the basic questions up front and allows for any level of privacy you desire. <br/>Lloyd was very responsive and able to make accommodations on very short notice. I would happily return to any of Lloyd’s places.

The suite was decorated with great taste and careful attention to details. Phat and Karley went above and beyond to accommodate us and make us feel at home with recommendations of nice restaurants in the area. Such a clean, quiet, and peaceful place! A hidden gem!"

He was there on a business trip and had to extend the dates a couple of times, and Allen made it easy! Would highly recommend staying at any of his properties!"

I don’t take super long showers, but the shower was hot for me the whole time. Would definitely stay here again if in the area."

Simple check in and check out. A few issues of cleanliness in the kitchen but he addressed them right away to ensure no future issues. One word of caution, the area looks a little sketchy late at night. Otherwise pretty good stay!"
11570,39864828,1748215988,2022-06-20,462451609,Matt,"Stayed here with my wife and two daughters as it was close to downtown museums and sites we were visiting. For sure it is a unique little nook with some cool ambiance. However, I wouldn’t recommend it as ideal for families with children. This is based off other Air BnB homes, and apts we’ve stayed in. Theres nowhere to step outside for fresh air to sit unless you want to go out into the street. If you like a little greenspace or a spot to sip coffee this isn’t the place. Beds and living room area are outstanding. Dishwasher didn’t work, and one of the burners on stove wouldn’t light. The cookware was a bit limited and pans pretty old. Found an unwashed cooking pan in the oven that was a bit disappointing. A few other cleaning issues I could probably nit pick about. However, like I said this is not really an ideal family vacation Air BnB. Great for younger people or those going out to bars or a show who aren’t necessarily needing amenities. Also no rulebook or guidebook explaining about towels, bedding, devices and so on which is typical in most Air BnB. Nonetheless, it is a neat spot in the under revitalization warehouse district of downtown Albany."

It was quiet all day and night and next to a very cute cafe as well as surrounded by impressive landmarks. Dillon went above and beyond as a host. I would recommend this place without hesitation."

14925,48172884,-767972305,2022-09-23,200822730,Jeff,"Stayed here for a short stint at Albany Medical Center. Very convenient 5 minute walk. The house is old and a bit creaky but for the price, location, and parking it’s an easy compromise. Room is small but the desk came in handy, AC worked well, bed was comfy, laundry is coin op but worked ok and there were detergent pods available. My only annoyance was the shower which is very small. I’m 6’ tall and I struggled to actually get clean in this thing and kept bumping my elbows on the walls, doors, and notably the brass temp control handles - which on a couple occasions fell off, luckily missed my toe."

It's 5-10 minutes from everything you need and there was a small side street right next to the house that made parking so easy which was a welcomed relief after spending the day in the city. There were only a few stairs to get into the home which was helpful for me as someone with limited mobility. Check in was very easy and the apartment was complete with little welcoming touches like tea, coffee, and seasonal decor. Jake responded to any questions within a couple minutes. Overall, it was an excellent stay :)"

Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to sight see because I was here for work. But if I come back just to do some sightseeing, I would definitely choose this space. It is perfect and was exactly what I was looking for. Shawn checked in to see how everything was and let me know to not hesitate to contact if I ever needed anything. The check in was smooth. I would recommend this space to anyone interested in staying in Albany."

It’s by a highway. We Ubered almost everywhere but the Ubers were all in the $10 range. <br/>I would have preferred if the apartment had a second lock, wasn’t crazy about the single lock. <br/>Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would book again!<br/>For cafes/restaurant recommendations, definitely try:<br/>Skinny Pancake<br/>Iron Gate Cafe<br/>The Hollow<br/>Ama Cocina <br/>Stagecoach coffee<br/>Also, the NYS museum was cool and you’ll be there for hours."

Off street parking was also a huge plus for a neighborhood with limited options. There was bit of street noise but it's what you would expect being in a city, not a problem for me at all and I am a light sleeper!  Nimble and nice, they are excellent hosts and I would  stay there again."

So I gave her 5 stars in all the categories for her place even though I didn’t stay because this was the only way I could give her a 5 star review.
291,3820211,31139264,2015-05-02,5941897,Kathleen,"We arrived to a clean apartment, with beer and water waiting, which was great. Also, the parking pass was amazing, and it is a fantastic location — so easy to get around. At night, it is loud, though. The bedroom is next to the patio of an animated bar, and it doesn't die down until after 2am on the weekend."

13508,45313545,1064937357,2023-07-06,409298948,Ken,"We had a lovely time at Kori's place. Loved the convenient layout with a great front and private back porch. The neighborhood was just right for us. Loved that there was off-street parking, tucked in the back, and it felt safe enough to leave an unlocked bicycle roped down on top of the car, awaiting repairs. The kitchen was not the most completely equipped - although it was perfectly adequate - but with all the nearby eating options (listed by our hostess), that was minor if moot aspect. Overall, we'd love to come back for another Albany visit."

It is really close to downtown so that makes up for it you can walk just about everywhere you want to go so that’s nice as well.

The kitchen has so many utensils, cup, mugs, and the like. It is like a chef’s kitchen. It is very spacious and quite. In short, it is a beautiful place but not suitable if you have toddlers. I have a toddler. The outside ambiance is more of a commercial area. I believe the place is a radio station before. The front door facing towards the street, if I am not mistaken, someone tried to open the door at evening, but it is not an issue because we managed on how to deal with it and I didn’t bother to call the attention of the host because it was just nothing. Overall, We feel safe. Moreover, it was snowing when we stayed and the place has a very good thermostat that keeps you warm. Overall, I think it is a very safe place to stay because they have security cameras and they have  a lot of comfortable pillows and play the cornhole game. Internet is very fast and the tv has netflix subscription."

It was an easy and safe walk to get to the Capitol building and downtown square as well as the park nearby. Lots of places to eat within walking distance. Had a great cup of coffee just around the corner. I recommend!

Our stay proved this to be true - the house was absolutely spotless which matters so much right now! You could tell that she puts a lot of thought into making sure her guests are comfortable and cared for. Tiny touches around the house at check in showed her compassion and dedication. Spending our thanksgiving here was so special. Definitely recommend!
5354,21752534,-727680487,2021-10-11,215075207,Jami,Host was very attentive and took care of everything! Check in was a breeze.  Street parking was tricky on Wednesday and Thursdays due to time restrictions—be mindful where you park (we got a ticket for parking on the wrong side).  Slippers are needed as it’s a no-shoe policy in the apt and the floor can be a little chilly to walk on (even with socks on).  Good access to restaurants and entertainment.

Very easy to walk or drive to nearby restaurants and nightspots. it's always a pleasure to talk to Sonya, who keeps a very clean and comfortable property, while also being very flexible and communicative. I've essentially stopped staying at hotels in the area whenever this property is available - it is a truly fantastic deal, and I cannot recommend it enough"

The private parking spot helped a lot because it is a relatively busy area and side of the road parking is hard to come by. Would definitely recommend staying here.

I got to the building tired and bedraggled from travel and got stuck outside the door because I couldn't make the code work in the door.  Terra was right there helping me through it and when I got into the apartment and it was a bit chilly (first cold day of the year), she provided me with a space heater just in case.  The apartment was sparkling clean and actually looked even nicer and bigger than the pictures.  I ate at a couple of neighborhood restaurants (a Jamaican take out across the street was especially friendly and delicious).  It's a neighborhood that is on it's way up and I felt safe there especially before dark as a single female.  Thanks, Terra!"

Exposed brick, modern stylish kitchen and bath (with a rain shower), and very comfortable bed and couch. Two huge TVs w/ all streaming services. Kitchen is fully stocked; bring shampoo for bath.<br/>Location: on street with fun bars and restaurants, just down from the Palace Theater. Blue 82 had great drinks and pizzas, and Far Shot Ax Throwing Bar looked interesting. For breakfast, the Skinny Pancake and Steuben St. Market are right next door.<br/>Tips: Since it's facing the busy street with huge windows, street noise is evident in the main room. Bring earplugs if you're sleeping on the couch (very comfy) and are noise sensitive. The bedroom is at the back and noise-free. Parking is on the street, but free after 5 and on weekends. No problems finding a spot. Check-in and out couldn't be easier.<br/>Thanks for the great weekend, I hope to return."

We traveled with my husband's mother, and it was great to have a bedroom on the ground level so she didn't have to walk upstairs. Close to major roads and yet a quiet neighborhood & private setting- great to sit on deck and listen to the birds. <br/>Chris was easy to contact & we had no problems.  We extended our stay & will be coming back again- a good bargain when traveling with multiple adults "

14660,48052353,1621843711,2022-08-07,210399759,Col,Great place - nicely renovated with great communication.  The living room and dining room are really comfy and nicely appointed.  The AC units keep the place a very pleasant temperature even on 90 degree days.   The only flaw is (like others mentioned) the beds are uncomfortable.  The double beds kinda sink toward the middle so you’re on a weird angle and there is no back support.

Adam was a gracious host and made sure that my co-worker was well fed and comfortable.  Thank you Adam for providing him a 'home away from home'.  What follows is a review from my co-worker who stayed with Adam...<br/>""My two months stay at Adam's house was awesome. I just can't describe it. It far exceeded my expectations. Adam was a father, a guide, very friendly and always ready to help. He was very concerned about my security and made sure I was always safe. I enjoyed the good food that he prepared for me morning, afternoon and evening. He provided me with everything I needed. My room was regularly cleaned and clothes regularly washed. Adam really treated me well and I will always stay at his place anytime I'm in the Albany area. I recommend his house to anyone coming to the Albany area.  I really thank Adam for allowing me to stay in his house during my time in Albany. God bless you Adam."""

Washington Park is also close by. The space is a lower level apartment in a historic area on a cute street. All the amenities were there minus a kitchen, as stated. Parking may be tricky in the evening as mentioned though I had no trouble during the day and there is a parking lot at the top of the street. I was attending a concert at SPAC and decided to stay a little further away to save some money and this place worked well -- convenient to drive outside the city to places like Saratoga Springs (45 minutes) or to stay and explore Albany, which I also took advantage of. If I were heading to Albany again I wouldn't hesitate to stay here."

This, to me, is what the intended spirit of airbnb was all about: normal people opening up their homes to travelers, not corporations buying up affordable housing and pricing local people out of the housing market. Alice's home is quirky, comfortable, and fun, and Alice is a great host, very accommodating and communicative. The location is convenient for walking to the Plaza and places to eat. Washington Park is right across the street and is a beautiful place to take a walk."

The short stair entrance to the downstairs apartment could be cleaner, as it made me hesitate a little of what I was getting into.<br/>   But once inside, hesitancy disappeared. We were pleased!<br/>   Park there before 6 PM. Afterwards, you'll need to pay for parking at the end of the block in a lot as it is residential."

The place was incredibly easy to find and access and it was great to have such a simple check-in / check-out process. <br/>The area may look a little run down when you're on the street from the outside, but don't let that fool you! We felt safe and sound on the street and at the apartment and it was so close to everything in Albany. I definitely feel that it was a great deal."

The house is beautiful, comfortable, very clean and in a great location. You can visit downtown without using the car, and you don't have to think about the parking (which is extremely rare in the States). <br/>Earl is very nice and communicative, always ready to help and give you all the information you need. I really recommend Earl and his place. We really enjoyed our stay and we will come back for sure!"

And there is a very nice bar/restaurant right at the corner.  The apartment is beautiful and well equipped with plenty of room.  Whenever we come into Albany we’ll try and stay here again.  It gets a strong recommendation from us; you won’t be disappointed.

The unit is private, spacious, and super-clean, with a great kitchen space and comfortable bed.

The parking was exactly as described, and when I had questions she responded promptly.  Her place was clean, and was in a secure building.  The neighborhood is centrally located, and other than people opening the door to come in, I heard no noise.  She was accommodating, and a wonderful host.  I did not rent the AirBnb to do activities, but if you are this is a great place to do so.  It was relaxing and felt like a home away from home.  I look forward to utilizing other properties she has posted as well.  The bed was comfortable, and she provided enough linens.  The biscotti and coffee were also great touches.  I will definitely be booking with her again."

The instructions were clear, the place was clean, and we were able to walk to good restaurants in the neighborhood. Since we arrived at night, the parking situation was not an issue for us. We just moved the car to the park once we woke up. We would stay again!<br/>Also, the tour of the Schuyler House nearby was really good if you’re interested in history, and we loved our brunch at Iron Gate."

The place did however have quite a fiddly lock, and when we experienced problems with our shower, we did not hear from the host on our inquiry neither during or after our stay. There were a couple cobwebs in the bathroom and the food in the fridge had gone bad a month ago. That being said, it did fill our needs for a quick stop over, with a comfy bed, a place to make our tea and all around a safe ans cozy neighbourhood for a super fair price 😄"

There's and entire wall of postcards from previous guests to back that up, and even the other guest I talked to had great things to say. He actually does make you breakfast in the morning, which is why there are pics of menu's posted. The room itself was nice. If you're in town for a short stay, I'd recommend this place."

The location was extremely convenient for going to Lark Street and even down further toward the river. It was also very easy to catch a bus as needed if we wanted to venture further out. The unit we stayed in met all expectations from the listing, and went above and beyond for comfort. There are many thoughtful touches that make the unit a nice little home away from home! Lloyd was also a very responsive and flexible host. We highly recommend this stay!"

14768,48124042,801687138,2022-01-16,19989785,Tonya,"All the basic amenities, well equipped kitchen, and great desk set-up and quick communication from Dillon. However, safety, cleanliness, and the heating could've used some improvements. Within 30min of arriving someone successfully used our door code and was about to enter the unit until I called out that we were there. I immediately told Dillon and asked him to change the code for us (which he did) and he said the guests had tried to enter the wrong door. But later the guests left a note saying that they were hoping to ""hang out there"" since the unit had been unoccupied earlier. Huh? Turns out they were staying next door. What's concerning is that we either had the same door code or that, if they had been hanging out there before we arrived, the door code wasn't changed. With no deadbolt or some sort of extra lock on the door, this mishap certainly didn't make us feel safe knowing that other guests were about to walk on in. Not to mention days later, there was an issue with the lock on the main building door which remained unlocked for about a day. It was eventually fixed. The central heating was just okay for our first two days but with the baseboard heater in the living room not working, it took a while for it to warm up. If you're coming in the winter, highly recommend bringing extra blankets if you can and wearing lots of layers as the central heating did virtually nothing when the very cold days hit. The windows are drafty even with the curtains drawn. And the thermostat was set to 90 and it never made it past 64 and blew out semi-cold air. Told Dillon all of this and wish that he could've provided us some sort of solution like space heaters or something. Lastly, the place was tidy but I wouldn't say clean. There was dust coated on the coffee table, the desk, end tables, floors, and other random surfaces when we arrived. We had to wipe everything down ourselves. The couch also had a lingering smell of smoke and heavy cologne which didn't make sitting on the couch seem inviting. Overall, good location and would be a nice space with some improvements, just maybe bad timing for us."

It was somewhat of a pain because the app would switch on and off between working with the tv. There’s definitely an older smell of the sort when you walk in. My guest immediately got a stuffed nose upon arrival but was cleared up after leaving by the next day. Everything was perfectly clean (one exception I messaged to Host about.) The bed frame is definitely nerve wracking as it creaks when you apply weight the mattress. Overall definitely  great for a short stay. The outside of<br/>The building is very dark, just a heads up. But everything was sparkling clean and the Host responded to any issues within a very reasonable amount of time."

The location of her home is literally next to some of the greatest places that Albany has to offer.  The neighborhood was nice, very friendly, as were all the dogs that were being walked.  I met a few of them.  The only draw back was parking and that wouldn't have been a problem except I was hauling a lot of equipment.  However, for city dwelling the parking was fine."

14469,47943571,-585377919,2021-06-16,397225893,Tessa,"I never give bad reviews, but my experience with Dillon was far from ideal and left me in a very bad situation. However, I would like to be as fair and honest as possible. I am a student who was interning in a lab at the NY Department of Health. When I looked for apartments back in March for the summer, I had several options, but I picked Dillon’s because it was at a slightly cheaper price for being a private one bedroom with a kitchen in “the heart of Albany.” I wish now I would have paid a bit more for a more sturdy apartment or paid much less since the service I received could have been obtained at a much lower price. The main issue was that this is a very poorly built apartment.<br/>Since day 1, the air conditioning did not work properly. It leaked about a quart of dirty water onto the floor every night. Dillon actually approached us first and said the other apartment in the complex had an issue and asked if the maintenance person could check out ours. I said yes. Nonetheless, the problem was never fixed. The next day Albany experienced a somewhat severe storm. This is where the bulk of our problems originated. The other guest staying with me informed me that the kitchen ceiling was pouring water. I messaged Dillon, he already knew about it and had sent 5 workers to our unit without informing me. I came home from work to several people placing giant fans (when I say giant I mean 3.5x2x2 foot) in this very small apartment. These fans were dehumidifiers that were extremely loud, limiting access to the kitchen and forcing us to stay in the bedroom with the broken AC. They also generated a significant amount of heat, heating the apartment to above 85 degrees. <br/>When I messaged Dillon about this, he said this was all new to him, and he was working with the insurance to find a solution. I can understand that. I can imagine that this was stressful for him, the storm itself was not his fault. That said, what ultimately came from all of this was unacceptable and the reason for the low review. <br/>Dillon offered me three solutions 1) allow me to stay in the apartment with a discount during the renovation process, 2) allow me to remain in the unit until the renovation begins, then put me in a hotel for a week (and only a week regardless of renovation duration) and discount the apartment while I did not have use of a kitchen, or 3) have me find a new Airbnb and he will refund me. <br/>I checked the other Airbnbs and at the time of searching there was only one that cost $16,000/month. I promptly responded that I could not take option three because of that reason. I then talked with my parents because I am not confrontational and frankly have a hard time knowing when I am being taken advantage of. <br/>After discussion and some math, what I was being provided was a non-private (the workers were there from 9am-6pm), kitchen-less, and loud apartment. The apartment also had no air conditioning even before the storm. As such, I countered with what I thought an appropriate discount would be. Out of full transparency, I said I would pay $20/day as long as I don’t have a private apartment with access to a kitchen because I could not eat out for every meal. Considering he could not rent out the apartment to other people, I figured he’d still be making money, and I wouldn’t be paying for things I am not receiving. On multiple occasions, Dillon suggested that the renovations had not yet begun in the apartment even though the ceiling was destroyed and repair people were in there. He could only remedy the situation once the renovation had begun, not the “demolition.” For me the product was the same, and it wasn’t fair that I was paying so much when I could have stayed in a non-private apartment with roommates for much cheaper. <br/>After my response, Dillon said he would get back to me in the morning. I woke up to my reservation being canceled due to “natural disaster.” This was the only option that would not have worked for me. Granted he allowed me to stay until the 20th of June (5 days after cancellation). However, there have been no new airbnb accommodations; I am not staying in a new Airbnb right now. The problem is, this wasn’t a natural disaster, this is a poorly buiqltq apartment. It is my belief that Dillon took advantage of the policy because he was unhappy that I asked not to be taken advantage of before the renovation began. He was perfectly willing to allow me to stay through said “natural disaster renovations” until I countered.<br/>Ultimately, Airbnb did refund my stay, but Dillon’s actions were not only unprofessional but rather careless and dishonest. I work all day and come back to study for grad school exams in the evenings. Dillon was aware of these circumstances. His lack of empathy and his refusal to provide with an honest service is why I’m writing this review. I strongly urge you DO NOT stay here if there is any chance of rain or care at all about having a functioning AC unit. The apartment is made to look good, not be sturdy."
15247,50207226,-484456197,2021-12-26,19022873,Ana Maria,"Pot smoke in unit coming from the heating and cooling system was very strong. If you're considering one of these rentals, I would rent the one on the 3rd floor. Linda as a host is amazing - and this is why I am giving this rental 5 stars - I think it is important to keep good hosts in the limelight on Airbnb so we all keep being able to find great hosts on this platform. The host had the good fortune of someone checking out of the unit on the 3rd floor the day after I checked in and when I noted the pot smoke throughout the entire unit and she was able to move me up there after her cleaner cleaned the unit for me. I REALLY appreciated the offer to switch units since the pot smoke was much less bad on the 3rd floor and without this I would have had to cancel my reservation and move to a different rental elsewhere or a hotel. All of her units are technically non-smoking and there are heavy fines for smoking in her units, so I was pretty confident in reserving that the units would be clean and not have any smell, and I can tell that Linda takes a great deal of pride in keeping her units neat, tidy, fully-stocked, modern, and very clean. But there is a tenant in the basement who I can only assume is a smoker and the smoke and the smell permeate the apartment building. That said, it really mostly affects the ground floor unit the strongest and the 3rd floor unit the least. Apart from that there were only minor things which other reviewers have mentioned-- the shower is only hot for a short shower, so don't wash your hair if you have long hair, and the stairs to the top floor are very narrow and steep, so don't bring too many items, or try to remain compact for minimal stress. Other than that, it was a great stay. The apartment is in good condition, well-located to downtown and lots of great food options nearby. Everything is clean and new and items are replaced if needed. Her communication is among the absolute best on the platform and she really looks after her guests. I also think it's super rare and wonderful that she allows dog guests with a reasonable fee and that is wonderful if you are traveling with your pet and would like to stay somewhere with a kitchen (there are a few hotel chains that allow pets, but obviously you won't have a kitchen). The apartment itself gets wonderful light morning and afternoon and has a nice little backyard area. Lots of parking. Some have noted that it is close to some train tracks, and it is, but I didn't find the noise from the trains that distracting or that loud. They are right there (a cool old bridge that the trains go over) and it's the main vista from the windows, but I found it to be pretty tolerable. Recommend a stay here, just be mindful of the situation with the smoke from the ventilation system. It might perhaps be better in the summer when you can leave windows open or when people aren't spending as much time indoors."

She even stocked the fridge with fresh fruit, yogurt, eggs, and supplies for breakfast burritos! WiFi was reliable and fast. Fluffy pillows and fresh clean linens made my nights very comfortable.  I would caution light sleepers like myself that sounds from the unit above do transfer easily to the ground level unit where I stayed (not that anyone up there was doing anything loud, but kitchen sounds, footsteps, and doggie paws were very audible through the floor). When unexpected winter weather changed my plans, Molly was super accommodating and helped me extend my stay for another night. I had everything I needed, was comfortable, and was very pleased with the convenient location within a short walk of the Empire State Plaza.

Being on the 6th floor (the building has 8 floors) gives you a very good view.  You are within walking distance of a lot of great restaurants, Lark Street and Washington Park.  Even WITH a car, Albany is a pretty navigable city.  <br/>The building is a historic building with many of its original architectural features intact.  That said, this unit has been renovated.

We had a great stay. Molly communicated well, check in went smoothly, and the space was clean and accurately described. It's a spacious lower level apt in a historic townhouse so there are residents above- bring earplugs if you're sensitive to neighbor noise. Parking was easy (weeknight), and Molly's space is literally in the heart of downtown, within walking (or short bike or drive) distance to much of what Albany has to offer. We'd certainly recommend a stay; it's a great value in this oft overlooked city in NY."

I was there for a night with my pup and it was amazingly cozy with so much room and amazing amenities.

As noted in the description there is a door for the toilet, but the shower area, tub, bed, and living area are all open floor plan. This actually made the area so much more spacious and appealing for me, but a heads up if a group needs privacy for whatever reason. <br/>Everything in the loft is very high quality from the super soft towels to the multiple large tvs to the incredibly comfortable bed and huge sectional couches. <br/>A bonus I wasn’t expecting was a few skylights that made soothing sounds from rain overnight. <br/>I’ve never been so pleasantly surprised by a stay and would absolutely come back and recommend to others!"

139,1489424,317681324,2018-09-02,212647472,Marcelita,What a wonderful respite in a quiet section of Albany! Both Dan and Efrat were so accommodating despite our late arrival. The basement room was well-lit and had comfortable bedding. There was a tv in the cozy living space that we didn't get a chance to use. The water pressure in the shower was enough to wash away the stresses of traveling all day. I would book again if I was in the Albany area! Also grabbed a souvenir from the free library stand that's right outside their house.

Was in an excellent central location as well.<br/>One note for accessibility is that the stairs (up to the house and upstairs to the bedrooms on the 2nd floor) are quite tall and steep, so if you struggle with stairs this could be a difficult place to stay."

Each unit has met my needs, but Unit #4 was especially nice since it's along the back-side and quieter than the street facing units.  Hope to stay again when I'm back in Albany."

265,3820211,20512666,2014-09-30,1771665,Susan,"This is a cute little place in the middle of the city that blends historic & modern touches.  The historic building is very cool & still has fixtures from when it was a police precinct.  That there is off-street parking is a big plus. The neighborhood is quite walkable & there's lots of little restaurants.  The Capital District has many activities: parks, the Hudson River, Erie Canal & the Baseball Hall of Fame is a nice day trip. Being that it is in the middle of the city, there is the typical city noise & a bar next door so if you are a light sleeper, that may be a consideration.  Terra was very easygoing & as helpful as we needed. They even came by and installed an extra bar to hang clothes on in the closet.<br/>The kitchen was well appointed as well as the bath. "

In addition he tirelessly worked on a disruptive guest matter; not sure why it took AirBnB 60 days fix it, but once that guest was removed, things improved drastically. <br/>I would offer only one caution...not every person has a good understanding about cleanliness and courtesy in communal living situations. Some renters/guests choose to live by a different set of rules regardless of what is posted for everyone. <br/>Overall 7/10: I enjoyed everyone's company, it was budget-friendly, spacious inside with nice views, quiet neighbors, close to the bus and lots within walking distance."

20803,-1092382218,395624635,2023-09-02,41096231,Elsie,"I've stayed in a lot of AirBNBs. This was the worst. I almost turned right around when I opened the door to this building. The entryway is dirty, cramped, and looks unmaintained. But I went up and things didn't get better. I immediately smelled cigarette smoke. There was an air cleaner and lots of scent sticks trying to cover it up. Also, my throat started getting scratchy almost immediately. I pulled out both filters in the portable AC, and they were filthy. There's a dirty rag stuffed in the window next to the AC output. I found a mouse trap under the couch that had poison bait. I brought my cat because it said it was pet friendly! Then, a live mouse appeared in the apartment, which I gently relocated outdoors. People want to supplement their income with AirBNB, but there have to be limits. The fridge smelled funky. While I was leaving hastily, someone was using the laundry & the whole entryway was humid & damp. Had to spend $$$ to change lodging at last minute to get out of here."

The neighborhood is very nice too. You are right on Lark so you can walk to a dozen or more decent places to eat and and drink and if you are inclined you could walk to down town and check the scene there.

803,5651579,449389656,2019-05-06,5179342,Mike And Ann,"Albany,<br/>Thank you for booking seven Madison Place. I have keys in the lock box underneath the steps to the right of the door. The top lock box code is 1964. Take the keys out and open up the door underneath the steps. Once inside go straight down the hallway the studio is there. If you have any questions just call me at 518-852-8974 thank you Gregg  <br/>Lark street. <br/>Oh dear what a disappointing joint. Little natural ventilation and poor natural light. Bathroom is a small and dimly lit affair (no windows) which you might share. The total lack of ventilation including NO exhaust fan is problematic especially if sharing with strangers. Access was dingy and a bit difficult. The most reasonable thing here is it’s location - this is strictly a place you’d only sleep in as the bed (and the place generally) was clean and comfortable. The picture on the Airbnb site is not where you stay. You stay under the stairs that you can see. You hear every step, tap and flush together with some muffled conversation from the people who live right above you - but we could live with that - some might not. The kitchen was rough - with little in the way of welcoming goodies - one can live without a chocolate heart on the pillow but some milk in the frig would have been nice. No host input unless you ring him. At least Gregg sounded reasonable and he was helpful when we needed to leave our bags here for 3 hrs after checkout. Regrettably this place needs much more than that. As an experience it certainly was not a great one. It represents poor value for money and would at just about any price point. In a way this joint is an analogue of Albany itself - lovely architecture but a disgrace in terms of poor roads and run down infrastructure. This is a poor offering and may give Airbnb a poor name. We were super hosts from 2013 until 2017 and if we had received a review this bad we’d go into terminal depression and then slit our throats. It’s a bit hard to write such a damning review especially when Gregg seemed so accomodating."
19718,1418652405,-1479166558,2022-10-28,15834481,Hans,The value of this unit is that it has three bedrooms and is within walking distance to downtown. Communication with the host was good. The host even provided a second parking permit for us.  The unit is appropriate for a younger crowd. I would not recommend it for an elderly person as there are some very steep stairs to carry luggage.

He offered great options for places to eat and things to see/do while we were there. The place didn’t offer a full kitchen but never fear! There was an electric burner, toaster oven, and microwave so you can absolutely make do. It seemed Earl had truly thought of everything! We highly recommend this place if your visiting Albany and would certainly stay here again."

Really nice deck outside to hang out on. I especially liked the view in the back yard of the pretty church behind the property.  So much nicer than seeing other houses. Cheerful flowers planted in front yard and in big pots near the deck. Very nice welcoming touch.  Our dogs were comfortable and relaxed in the house right away and there was even a nice sized fenced in area in the yard for them, with shade.   We highly recommend Peter as a host and the house is a great place to spend time in. Not to mention a super convenient location within walking distance to restaurants, shops and Albany U."

8223,28722270,1766081386,2021-09-27,49997304,David,"Cleanliness:<br/>4/5<br/>The place was fairly clean and looked great!<br/>Minus 1 point because:<br/>-carpets need a little better cleaning<br/>-high up cabinets and light fixtures need better dusting/cleaning<br/>-The window AC really needs to be replaced/cleaned.  It is moldly inside and is only about 50% efficient at cooling.<br/>-The ceiling leaked when it rained one day, above the living room bed.  I messaged him and he was going to get it fixed.<br/>Accuracy:<br/>4/5<br/>The AirBNB pics closely match what you get, but here are some differences:<br/>-There is about 50% of the light up there versus the pics<br/>-The bed room and bathroom look a little bit smaller than the pics.<br/>Check-in:<br/>4/5<br/>Check in was smooth.  <br/>Parking was in the back on Bleecker St, there is no rear entrance.<br/>The lock on the front door to enter the complex (not the room itself) was a little tricky at first to open up.   You have to wait a few seconds after entering the code then press the red button on the bottom.<br/>Communication<br/>5/5<br/>Always prompt communication with us.  <br/>Location<br/>2.5/5<br/>Pros:  <br/>-About a 7 minute walk to the Plaza, Museum, and the Egg<br/>-It is located across from the GreyHound bus station.  <br/>-While it is right next to the interstate, it is very quiet here.<br/>Cons:  <br/>-Abandoned building close to the apartment with overgrown vegetation.<br/>-A couple of homeless people begging for money<br/>-Groups sitting around smoking pot.  <br/>It's not dangerous at all,  but will definitely put off people who are not used to the city life.   <br/>Value<br/>5/5<br/>This is a very good price for the location.  <br/>Other Notes:<br/>-The beds are 6/10 for sleeping.  Soft mattresses that dip in slightly when you lay on them.  That is my opinion.<br/>-The beds are both positioned under a 45 degree incline of the roof.  This may be claustrophobic for some, but I thought it was cozy.<br/>-There are 2 A/Cs,  one is portable and the other is a window AC, which is in need of replacement.  We had to run both full throttle to keep it relatively cool.  We were not able to get the temperature below 71.  We were not in the apartment during the day but it would probably get hot during a summer day up there.<br/>-Good shower pressure.<br/>-There are 4 flights of stairs to climb to get to the apartment and they can get steep."

Giving a lower rating only because the place didn't look completely sanitized and upon entering the bathroom there were bugs.<br/>Location however is amazing, but I personally didn't feel comfortable enough to spend the night and left 3 hours into my stay. You do get what you pay for, an entire apartment for a super affordable cost."

Similar to other reviews, it is a little chilly so I’m glad I packed a sweatshirt to sleep in. Some complained of noise due to a nearby bar, but to me it was 100% bearable and in no way disturbed my sleep or overall experience. One note, the bathroom isn’t all the way finished but still was very clean and usable. Overall, I would recommend staying here and will request to stay here again if I’m ever back in Albany!"

It is located on the lower (basement) level, which was very nice during a hot late summer week. I barely needed air conditioning at all! The studio is well-appointed and has what you'd need to cook a meal. In-unit laundry was a final very welcome perk. I would say that Gregg's place is perfect if you're looking for somewhere for 1-2 people right near downtown/capitol area. It was great for me for a 1 week work trip, and I'd stay again."

The area can go either way.  if you walk 1 block in the wrong direction you are in a very bad neighborhood but 1 block the other direction and you are basically downtown with all the restaurants bars and shopping.  me myself would rent this place again hands down, but if I was with my family I probably would not just because of the location it was in.  The host was super responsive and answered all of my questions very fast."

Only con was that it smelt like cigarettes so we had to wash everything we brought with us since the smell stuck to everything. Overall, a positive experience. Would recommend."

19724,1049876140,-1965456383,2022-09-05,307306058,Ryan,"I suppose this is decent value for what you're getting in a not great neighborhood in that it meets the bare minimum. The hosts were very accessible and willing to communicate.<br/>However, beware that the 4th bed is a folding mattress in the closet that needs to be set up in the dining room. Many of the pillows were without pillow sheets, the shower was dirty, and there was a persistent beeping noise coming through the walls that I couldn't trace. They also asked that we take the trash out but didn't provide any trash bags and access to the building's dumpster was locked.<br/>If you need a place for a few people to crash and won't be spending much time there, then this is fine"

It was a renovated older house, the high ceilings make it look massive when you enter. Everything was modern but homey at the same time.  I will say the street can get a little noisy but that was not a problem at all as the bedroom is in the back.  The location is great as it's close to eveything, but I will say (having lived in this area) I would be cautious and street smart if walking alone at night as it is a diverse area in the city and can get rowdy on weekend nights.   This was a great stay, would recommend the host and the beautiful BnB!"

The place was very spacious, beautifully decorated and quiet.<br/>We had difficulty parking in the designated spot as  we couldn't back out due to proximity of other vehicles, and the building so most of the time we parked on the street or side of the house which worked out just fine."

We loved how the old charm of the space was honored, with all its historic details apparent and clear, yet at the same time maintained with cleanliness and outfitted with beautiful modern furnishings and details. Everything of the little touches from the cozy dimming lamps to the spa like shower spray really enhanced the vibes of our stay. The couch was super comfy, and the color palette of the interior design was so gorgeous we couldn’t stop remarking to each other how everything just flowed so well! <br/>One note to guests, you can’t park on the street of the house so bear that in mind. We luckily found parking around the corner. <br/>Also, there was some outside noise late at night. But that’s city life.<br/>Overall, I would highly recommend this stay. Lori was super responsive, caring and accommodating."
12020,40828178,-41109107,2021-10-03,349237461,Isabella,"This stay was nice, it was quite and everything was nicely decorated and clean. The only reason I’m not giving this stay a 5 star is because unfortunately the hot water did run out and my boyfriend and I had to take an uncomfortably cold shower. Given the price point for this stay (~ $300 to stay the weekend), I was incredibly disappointed about the cold shower. The parking situation isn’t ideal but it’s manageable (alternate street parking), doesn’t impact the quality of the stay at all. To enter/leave the residence is very convenient because of the lock pin pad, all you need is a code to get in and out. This stay also offers a ton of information on the area as well as suggested places to explore. Overall would recommend"

The hosts were clear about the last time people had stayed in the unit, and since it had been awhile we didn’t have to wipe down surfaces or worry about that kind of thing. The apartment is perfectly located—5 minutes walking to the Capitol complex and a ton of great restaurants, bars (not that we could visit them), and coffee shops in the surrounding neighborhood. The unit itself was comfortable, clean, and spacious for two people. The kitchen was fully equipped and the bathroom was well stocked with soaps/washes etc. The bed and seating areas were great, and there’s a smart tv you can connect to.

Earl was super accommodating and communicative- he really made every aspect super easy for my group of 5. Great layout, nice taste in furniture, and thoughtful “right at home” touches such as towels on all beds, coffee, and even simple things like ample paper products. It was also nice that we were trusted with access and autonomy to enjoy our time I. Town with friends.  Thanks Earl!"

251,2992450,28524578,2015-03-25,5485362,John,"Kenneth was ready when I got there and arranged for the upstairs neighbor to meet me at the door with the keys.  Shortly after that I was left on my own in the privacy of this large 2 BR apartment - just like I like it.   I really like my privacy and there was no time at which anyone came to visit me or bother me unannounced.  At one point Kenneth had to pic up a refrigerator stored in the apartment, but the neighbor lady gave me plenty of notice and I was on my way out before he got there.  When I returned the extra refrigerator was gone and I had the nice quiet apartment to myself.  At one point I went to take a shower and found some body wash in a drawer.  That was nice since all I brought with me was shampoo.    The apartment is a city street apartment meaning that like many two family homes the BR window is feet away from the public sidewalk and you can hear people all hours of the night walking by and conversing, but its not terribly disruptive.  Overall the apartment was just what I needed and I had an enjoyable time while there.  The heat worked perfectly and the apartment was picked up.  The bed was a king size and very comfortable with sensible pillows and coverings.  The water pressure on the shower was awesome."

The host Diana was a great host and responded promptly to all of my messages. If I ever need to book another room for  a trip to Albany in the future this would probably be number one price and quality wise. Stay here and you won’t regret it!

Il fait cependant très sombre dans la chambre puisque c'est au sous-sol. La connexion wifi est très bonne et la cuisine assez bien équipée! Parfait pour un couple ou personne seule.
1065,6623339,315762254,2018-08-29,98989737,Sean,"Terra's place was better than expected.  The apartment is on a somewhat busy intersection so my first assumption would be an issue with street noise, but I had no issues when trying to sleep.  The location is perfect with numerous restaurants and bars around.  There were also no issues with safety.  The entrances to the building have coded locks and the door to the apartment has 2 locks as well.  Overall, I enjoyed my time at Terra's place."

We appreciated the window AC unit and the fan, as the weather was warm and humid during most of our stay. Sue is a great communicator with fast responses! As noted in the listing, the apartment is a BASEMENT unit - we did hear some noise from the residents above us (there was one evening where it sounded like there was a very upset child, and there was no hot water left for our showers; the other two evenings had no issues at all). Also, there is only street parking available (we were able to find parking within half a block every night); we gave Sue our car information so we did not have to move the vehicle every 2 hours (assume there is some sort of temporary electronic permit she submitted for our vehicle). All in all, a good stay in a central location."

3315,11639446,203255252,2017-10-14,135083121,Catherine,"This was my second stay with Adam- he really goes above and beyond to make sure his guests have an outstanding stay. He made it much easier to plan my trip and took the stress out of traveling. His airbnb description is quite humble, but as long as you care more about personality and character than some of the things a fancy hotel can offer, then you won't be disappointed. I've been at nice hotels that had worse physical conditions that didn't offer any of the sense of community, caring, or hospitality that Adam shares with his guests."
16816,52836323,-737130051,2023-08-19,116102164,Nathalie,"The unit had not been cleaned prior to our arrival. Garbage cans were full, refrigerator still contained food, and dirty dishes were left in the kitchen sink. We had to change the bed sheets ourselves (lucky we had our own), disinfect the bathroom and wash dishes so we could eat. We immediately contacted Airbnb and the owner. On two different occasions a promise of full refund was made by the owner herself.<br/>Unfortunately, we only got a partial refund (ironically including the cleaning fee).  Two weeks later the promised full refund has still not been made. We have been patient and understanding, but we find that the owner, Diana, does not take us seriously and do not take her responsibilities. <br/>Be advised that she responds when she sees fit and has not kept her promise of a full refund. She's not worth doing business with. It's a pity, but nearly 2 weeks have passed, giving her plenty of time to resolve the problem."

However highly not recommended for the following reasons :<br/>1- property is in a really sketchy neighborhood <br/>2- if you get locked out as the chances of you forgetting the keys inside are high. She is not available and you have to wait hours before help arrives. <br/>3- nowhere to through your trash, if you leave inside the trash bags within the apartment , you will be charged additional $50.<br/>4- Bathroom ceiling tiles are simply glued, the shower curtain fell leading the ceiling tiles to fall on the sink. Additional damage billed to us."

I think what really impressed me the most were the details. My towel was wrapped in plastic, there was a makeup mirror in the room (not that it was much use to me, but I could still appreciate its utility), the fan was on when I got there, Adam personally stood out in the street when I was backing my car out. When it was time for me to check out at 6 a.m., he had a bagged breakfast and lunch ready for me to take. <br/>Adam's got a real heart for hospitality and the only thing I wish I could have changed was my own schedule so I could've stayed longer. I hope I get the chance to come back."

Only 40-50mins away from Lake George, amazing places to eat that were about a 10-12min drive from the place (Cafe Madison😍). The room itself was super clean and the poker theme was just straight up cool. The room was so aesthetically pleasing. Diana puts so much thought into her guests when preparing the room for a stay and her communication is spot on. Any time you need her she’s literally a text away and it was absolutely a joy to stay here and have her as a host. Will DEFINITELY be back when we take another trip back up from Queens to Albany!

The AC kept it nice and cool (it’s over a pizza place). There were plenty of restaurants in the area and cafes. It’s also within a short walking distance to a lot of the local landmarks. The apartment was exactly as pictured. The only cons of staying there were that the staircase is kind of steep and parking was a pain in butt because it was on street parking, and it’s a bit loud at night. Other than that it was a great deal and I really enjoyed my stay :)"

Very easy to communicate with. The space was cute, and our teenage son loved it! The only downsides were the stairs--many and steep--which were fine for us but would likely be difficult for anyone with a mobility issue or young families lugging stuff. It’s an attic space, so it was stuffy and hot despite the air conditioning. The area does get a little desolate at night, but we found an excellent Italian restaurant within walking distance."

2561,10768745,195258397,2017-09-18,101081033,Joan,"The location of this room is excellent, the neighborhood lovely but this room is not as represented. Half of the house appears to be owner occupied and the other half a boarding house. The room I rented looked like someone was living there and moved out so a guest could check in. <br/>There were open bottles of juice and milk in the mini fridge, new but food items left,  many leftover toiletries in the bath including used bars of soap, a dish full of change on the top of a radiator. The closet was 3/4 full of old linens, pillows, junk, the floor wasn't even clear for my suitcase. Coffee pot was not clean. The room was filled with extension cords one being plugged into the next, this is a safety hazard, one was taped to the floor. <br/>The owner entered my room and unplugged the A/C when I ran out to buy a cup of coffee and told me I did not pay enough to keep A/C running or lights on if I were not in the room. <br/>There was no exterior lighting or hallway lighting so the only way to even get to the house or unlock exterior and interior door was with the flashlight on my phone.<br/>I wish I could post pictures that would actually show what this property looked like."

21079,-1728411693,2071603038,2023-08-14,191015646,Kaelan,"Unfortunately, we were left disappointed by our stay with Natasha. Check in was at 2PM, we arrived around 1:55PM to see if it was ok to enter. The host initially said we would have to wait because we were a bit early and the macitence man was still working inside, and that she'd call back to confirm. Ok, no problem. <br/>She called back a few minutes later to ask our names (as if she wasn't aware of who we were or forgot we were coming), and then stated that her past guest took the keys and we would have to wait for an hour before entering. All of this would have been ok, were understanding and easy going people, but Natasha did not apologize for the trouble once.<br/>Once we entered, we were surprised to see the toilet wasn't flushed, there was OPENED frozen meat in the freezer and a half eaten tub of ice cream. There was half of a dried out sausage in the fridge as well. The bathroom smelt strongly of mold, or sewer. Otherwise, it was clean enough.  <br/>Violent, loud fights outside as well."

This was by far the best and most unique AirBnB experience I’ve ever had. The apartment comes with a delicious complementary pizza and house-made beer from Cafe Cappriccio, the family’s restaurant next door, a lovely surprise that I won’t ruin for you, and some of the most friendly and welcoming people I’ve ever met. When I stopped into the restaurant to pick up my pizza, I ended up meeting 8 members of the family and hung out for about two hours, chatting about all sorts of things and having a grand old time. They welcomed me in like one of their own. They told me about all the intriguing and creative things they do at Cafe Cappriccio. They even invited me to go with them to see their niece perform at the Capital Repertory Theater the next day! Unfortunately, I was due to head home in the morning so I couldn’t join them but, how wonderful to be asked! Really, this place is truly one-of-a-kind. I might have to start inventing reasons to go to Albany more often… 😋. Marlene is kind, friendly, welcoming, and responsive. If you have any questions, she is very quick at getting back to you. Oh, and there’s parking. Need I say more?"

Quiet apartment with a private outdoor patio to enjoy the sunshine and fresh air are bonuses, and likely a favorite part of staying at Todd and Pan's place!

The room was exactly as advertised, clean, and had a nice view over the park across the street. The entire house was lovely, also clean, and you could tell care was put into making sure guests felt welcomed there. The hosts were also readily available if there were any questions and were very accommodating. If you are a medical student doing an away rotation at AMC, such as myself when I was here, this listing is exactly what you would need and is an easy five-minute walk from the hospital entrance."

Namely that it is sort of a large basement area: you enter a large, long hallway and there are a few rooms with a shared bathroom down the hall. There was also another guest staying in one of the other rooms; we did not interact but that was certainly a surprise. Also lots of items in the hall, so that might bother some folks, but the room has less ""stuff"" in it."

We were able to unload our car nearby but had to park a couple blocks away. The neighborhood was quaint and historic and we felt safe."

There was plenty of room, with both an upstairs and a downstairs bedroom options. The backyard is a ravine, which is not safe for children, but they had a great time running around the front yard and introducing themselves to the neighbors and their pets.

Everything really is clean and smells fresh. Terra was not there to greet me, but that is OK; she is very responsive by text messaging. You should know that the apartment is on a busy street and there are bars and restaurants close by, so there is some music/noise. I am usually sensitive to that, but I really slept like a baby because the bedroom is pretty quiet. "

She showed us this one that was available, and it worked out perfectly!<br/>The host provides all streaming platforms on the TV, which, was the first time I had encountered that and was very welcome instead of forgetting to sign out of my own upon departure.<br/>Just be aware the parking isn't the easiest to find as it is not clearly labeled on the street, and it took us a few loops to find the spot as there are two separate lots for the apartment complex. The spot for this location is located past the garage in a small alleyway and the spot is labeled on the wall and ground in white spray paint. The easiest way to access it in my opinion is from S Pearl Street directly across from the Albany Housing Authority.<br/>And the final thing of simple note is the Hot and cold water in the shower/tub at least during out stay were labeled opposite but knowing that it is very easy to figure out.<br/>But overall, a stellar location and directly down the street from the police station which definitely added to a feeling of security. The natural lighting from the large windows was nice and the apartment itself was well maintained. Would definitely stay again!"

14335,47440071,-2039410554,2021-07-21,36623219,Mikail,"Buell House Loft is a magical oasis in the heart of Albany.  Just minutes from the airport and both 87 and 90, it is both easy to get to and from.  However, the heated pool (April-October) and whimsical decor will make you reluctant to leave.  A quick glance shows a country game room, but a closer look shows cardboard, fake fur, and plastic eyes of a child’s oversized stuffed animal collection staring down from the real all-wood 200 year old beams.  High ceilings, remote control fans, and state of the art plumbing (including a pedestal tub and glassed in shower) and fully set up wet bar with wine fridge make visiting a treat.    The pool sits deep in a hollow of the large rolling lawn with large trees to the left of the house with a whole range of outdoor seating options including several under a covered porch for inclement weather. Tom and his friends and associates are the kind of people you want to know more, but they’ll happily give you space if you want to do your own thing.  Two energetic white dogs add to the fun.<br/>Nearby eateries include Jr’s, the Point, and Cafe Madison (special oat meal pancakes with apples and walnuts are to die for). All three are together on the same block with Price Chopper grocery store and CVS —about a five-ten minute walk from Buell House.<br/>We were visiting from Austin (my husband grew up in Utica but we’ve lived in Texas for 30 years), so we wanted to take advantage of being so close to visit Olana in Hudson NY and Thomas Cole’s homestead across the river in Catskill NY.  The “cats” of Catskill figures on Main street and the Mermaid Cafe between tours of both artists’ estates (reservations at both sites required) make for a relaxed day with plenty of pool time at Buell House before dinner.<br/>A couple of minor glitches occurred but Thomas warned us in advance and resolved each issue quickly with grace and a bit of humor.  None of us got into Airbnb expecting perfection but because we wanted a more personal experience with a touch of adventure and the unexpected.  Tom delivers on all fronts.  We give Buell House our highest recommendations and hope to return."

The space itself was clean, cozy and offered additional amenities that hosts don't normally provide (drinks available for Venmo purchase in fridge, Roku television, bathroom toiletries, etc). Although the space was in the basement, you would never have known as it was very quiet. Lloyd had everything labeled so there was no confusion about how to operate something.

9564,32993402,-1713169388,2021-08-29,416673207,Matthew,"Upon arrival, the apartment had a terrible musty smell which made us question the cleanliness of the property. Other than that (and not all air conditioning working) everything was going OK until the morning of our check out Earl messaged us with crazy accusations of noise complaints and violating the smoking policy. All of these accusations were unfounded and any evidence he attempted to provide were completely false and inaccurate. For example, Earl stated we “turned off his noise detection alarms at 12:58am”, when in fact we had not even been in the apartment at that time. <br/>Furthermore, in the thread of false messages sent by Earl he stated we cost him money because another tenant “cancelled their week long stay” based on our noise and smoking. Again, screenshots provided in an attempt to prove his point were completely inaccurate and the time stamps from those screenshots have absolutely no correlation to our presence in  the apartment. <br/>When we very quickly pushed back on these accusations and called Earl out on this very clear attempt at scamming us into paying additional fees he quickly changed his story and said it must have been another apartment he confused us with. This behavior was completely unacceptable and caused us to feel very threatened with the irrational scare tactics being sent our way after only being in the air bnb for less than a full day. We quickly checked out before our designated check-out time for this reason which drastically effected our stay in Albany.<br/>I would never recommend another guest to stay in any of Earls properties would suggest everyone to avoid him at all costs."

She talks slow and gentle, always patient and kind.<br/>The only thing, if you have to find a little less convenient is the street parking, it may not be an issue for everyone. I always came from the uptown side, the 1-way streets make me drive two more blocks. This has nothing to do with the host, but with the APD. If you drive around Albany, you will the see the traffic lights always turning against you, those are the tricks of APD, they want to make up some more traffics for their job security.<br/>Other than this, enjoy staying."

The place was immaculate, with an awesome shower, extremely neat and clean, very comfy huge bed, and big flat-screen tv with many viewing options.  The little extras like toiletries, toothpaste, snacks and drinks in the fridge were so thoughtful!  Only a few blocks from Maria College, right off New Scotland Ave."

Very easy check in and very convenient parking onsite.<br/>The best part was probably location. Close to all types of shops and restaurants. <br/>My wife and I enjoyed walking the streets, checking out the stores and enjoying the local eats (& drinks/coffee). Great recommendations from the host.<br/>The only negative is that the walls are thin so we could hear the neighbors upstairs enjoying their Friday night pre gaming before heading out. But nothing that would stop me from staying there again. <br/>I would highly recommend this spot! great price for amazing location."

3769,14316232,166817844,2017-07-04,102522793,Jonathon,The room was exactly as pictured in the photos. <br/>I stayed here with my fiancée and our small dog for the July 4th weekend. We wanted to get away and hike the region. Nicholas place was the perfect spot to do this from. Upon arrival we found the log book which listed his favorite hiking spots in the area which we definitely checked out. <br/>The house itself is walkable to the main toad but far enough away to be outside the city. It was he perfect blend of quite but not secluded quite. <br/>The bathroom which is on the first floor had something I haven't seen in a home before (a stand up men's urinal). It also had the standard toilet but be warned it's under the stairs so if your tall don't stand up fast or you may bump your head. <br/>Overall I highly recommend staying here and exploring the area either on foot or by car.

We walked from there to downtown and back at night and felt completely safe (of course you need to be diligent anywhere you are unfamiliar), the neighbors were friendly, there’s a bodega on the block with great snacks, it was perfectly quiet at night, and the bed was comfortable. The apartment is super easy to get into and secure. It is decorated nicely without any clutter or personal touches (like family photos or mismatched decorations/tchotchkes). The bathroom could get tricky for larger bodies (as a NYCer, I know this story!). The furniture pieces are fairly simple, but perfectly comfortable. Would absolutely recommend and stay again:)"

Luckily, Scott's place provided everything we needed. Conveniently located in the student housing area, a few houses down from St. Rose's Safety & Security HQ, and just a block from both St. Rose and UAlbany's downtown dorms, Scott's Airbnb was surprisingly QUIET, super CLEAN, and IMPECCABLY DECORATED.

Allen was very quick to respond to questions/concerns both before booking and throughout my stay.  Very reliable Internet for WFH.  The second bedroom had a desk and rolling chair that was perfect for an office.  Had enough pots, pans, dishes, and oil, for multiple meal preparations.  Would recommend bringing K Cups for the Keurig.  The bathroom had a standup shower, tons of towels for the longer stay, and motion lighting.  Tons of storage and shelves in the bath, kitchen, and both closets.<br/>You can hear the people that stay downstairs, very typical of older upstate homes.  All the other guests I bumped into were friendly, and were not loud at all during my stay.<br/>Walked and jogged around the neighborhood many times, lots of tree coverage and nice sidewalks.  Seemed to be located near a number of major streets making the city very accessible.  There is a nice string of bars and restaurants right across the street ranging from breakfast to late night food, which you could not hear from the house."

There were kids toys and books strategically placed throughout the house (tucked away if you don’t have kids). The bathroom was full of helpful items, including things like makeup remover wipes and extra hair ties that you don’t find at most airbnbs. The CVS and grocery store right down the street meant we could easily stock up in toiletries, food, etc. Diana was incredibly accommodating and responsive. We could not have asked for a better stay.

You can hear the people in the apartment above, but they weren't running marathons or jammin' on a drum kit, so it wasn't disruptive. This is a great location for anyone who likes to explore a city on foot. It is on the edge of a very funky and interesting neighborhood, close to a grocery store and you can easily reach the downtown core through Lincoln Park."

All the cleaning products (which are environmentally & allergen conscious) are easily accessible for us to clean behind ourselves. 10/10 will be staying here again if available!"

4404,17238066,-1858443352,2023-05-29,12881801,Ami,Adams place was as described. He was very helpful and responsive. He went above and beyond to help with everything.
11318,39836487,-165524827,2022-03-15,21282061,Tom,"I have been using AirBNB for many years and this is the first review I have given that wasn't positive. Be aware that the stairs are really steep all the way to the third floor. The apartment faces the street so you hear the street noises all night long. There are no bowls in the kitchen so the breakfast we brought with us wasn't able to be eaten. The bed is not real comfortable and against the wall so if the inside person has to get up at night, you either crawl over the other person or pull yourself out the end. If these things don't matter to you, the location of the apartment is good and Adem was responsive when I needed to speak to him."

Lots of room both in the rooms and common spaces, kitchen, living and dining rooms, definitely worth the price. We had an event in center square and it was a super short drive. Great place and great location."

I enjoyed a walk around Washington Park and relaxing on the front porch reading a book. My room and bed were cozy and close to the shared bathroom.  Very quiet, comfortable stay."
3922,15580397,-1609380969,2024-03-08,49748471,Sandra,"I read the nasty reviews and booked anyway. Yes, Share has rules, don't you? It's her house, she lives alone, and lives in Albany. Although she lives in a safe neighborhood, she doesn't know you and the camera's made me feel safe. I stayed 8 nights and no issues. Her place was clean and I had everything I needed. I didn't need to use her kitchen, the microwave was sufficient. I was there to sleep and shower. If you don't like to follow rules, I don't want you staying at my house either. Move on and pay double. I would definitely stay with Share again."

8394,28722270,1214371720,2024-02-12,227011383,Alex,"Location of the stay is the best part for me. A lot of things were in walkable distance due to the bnb being located in downtown. Pretty much across the street from the greyhound station which was super clutch in my opinion.<br/>All in all, great overall experience being hosted by Earl & Mohammed.<br/>-Alex"
10013,33558235,-171817021,2022-04-19,124106164,Sarah,"Do not understand the reviews here. The place is large and the beds seemed fairly comfortable but that's about where the positives ended. The place was LOUD, you could truly hear every footstep above you, dirty, unsafe, and not at all as pictured. The chain on the front door was broken and the area was simply not safe enough to stay in with a broken chain on the door and how accessible the back was. If this is close to where you want to be it may be acceptable for a single night but I cannot imagine this as a comfortable stay other than that. Most of the furniture in the living room was not actually there including the table, rug, and many of the stools and chairs. There was a funky smell and it just felt grimy. If I were a freshman in college and a frat guy invited me back to his place I might be impressed. As an adult looking for a nice vacation this was not acceptable. Earl was very communicative with automated messages but not so much when we brought up real issues. We stayed here about 15 minutes before booking a hotel nearby."

21506,1229756387,968647155,2023-06-23,515245404,Carlos,"Staying at Maria’s made me feel like a king the place was beautiful just like the pictures I felt like I was on a HGTV show after a house just being flipped she had everything you could possibly need ,it was like she knew what I had a need for before I did. The peaceful and seemed to be hand picked neighborhood was beautiful and quiet even with the booming night life I will definitely stay again and i recommend to  all who want a truly luxurious feel and peaceful place"
12403,43208391,1652215141,2021-07-07,404922090,Bennie,This spot was perfect. Extremely clean and private.

19562,2023522984,1589294333,2022-10-16,12029170,Wendy,"Diana's place was a great find for us! Four bedrooms with comfy beds and two full bathrooms. Off street parking too...walking distance to bars and restaurants only a half mile away on Madison Ave.  We, too, popped into the bar across the street for a little more party time after the wedding we attended in the area! Diana's place has all the little touches that make it special...she had bottled water in the fridge, a Keurig machine with pods, clean smelling linens...all around small touches that shows she really cares about her customers. The place was perfectly furnished with no extra clutter. Diana was easy to communicate with and very accommodating.<br/>This is outside Diana's control but do note that on a Saturday night, the area was a little loud late at night. It certainly did not bother us...it's what we'd expect when staying in a city."
5259,21752534,291199886,2018-07-15,102659371,Sean,"This is a nice place to stay. Allen has it freshly updated and clean. It’s in a bit more lively neighborhood than I expected being in a student-dominated area. It wasn’t too noisy for us, but something to keep in mind. There is also not a ton of natural light, but this place is well-cared for and a decent value and it suited our needs just fine."

First, Domini and her husband were extremely understanding when I was very late arriving -- I really appreciated their flexibility. Second, everything was exactly as described and as it appeared in the photos. Very comfortable bed, nice big living room (I brought my yoga mat and it was like having my own little studio!), a coffee machine, microwave, and mini-fridge -- pretty much everything you could want. In the morning, Domini left a breakfast cart for me and a box of homemade cookies to take home. She went above and beyond to make me feel welcome and to provide a lovely space to stay in. Would gladly return next time I'm in Albany."

The house was right on the corner of the street with parking in the back and a good sized back yard. This rental is renovated with modern fixtures and has a comfortable feel. Diana and her staff provided enough of the essentials to get us through our entire stay; garbage bags, dishwasher soap, etc. Having the ability to bring our dogs was what led to our decision on Diana’s home and it was the perfect choice for us. We were able to meet a couple of the neighbors and everyone was pleasant and welcoming. The 3 bedrooms and the bathroom are all upstairs. There are no electronics in any of the bedrooms so my son and I used our phones for alarm clocks and music as we prefer background noise to sleep. We didn’t get to use the porch area in the back of the house due to our short trip and cool weather but it looks like a fantastic place to be in the warmer months. The home was perfect to meet our needs and Diana is a charming host!"

The next day when I asked Jon’s wife where was the garbage can, she answered me yelling at me: it’s over there! Jon’s son since I arrived was very aggressive, he hit my wall and hit the floor every day and night since I arrived, his room was next to mine and was looking at me in a hostile way. I asked him politely to turn to the music bc it was 2am in the morning, he responded: I fucking live here! <br/>The heat was 65F all day and the left the house. <br/>They didn’t stop harassing me.

The air bnb itself could really use a deep clean. As for the apartment- spacious except for the bathroom. Should note that it is very hot (above a pizza place) and was very loud when we opened the windows to try and get some air in. Worked fine for what we needed but wouldn’t be back."

To put it plainly, this historic pad was smack dab in the middle of multiple craft pubs, kareoke bars and bustling cafes. We gorged on brunch, specialty pizza and pints upon pints of craft brews only to come back to ""our"" place and straight veg. Terra was an excellent host. From her communication, to the sheer amount of amenities supplied (guaranteed parking, for one). Reviews are subjective, and prone to bias but I can honestly say this place was well worth the money, and we wouldn't be opposed to staying here the next time wr decide to come up. "

In short, owner has thought of everything to make a comfortable, well appointed place to stay. As promised, patter of small feet can very occasionally be heard overhead but it's not at all unreasonable or objectionable.  Market is just around the corner. Restaurants are in easy walking distance.<br/>If you're there for concerts at the Egg, it's really too far to walk at night but it is only a 6 minute drive away.  We give it our highest recommendation."

The location is unbeatable: it's a five minute walk to the government plaza. The place itself is also clean, spacious, and comfortable. The only potential issue would be that this is a basement/street level room. This isn't necessarily an issue, but it could be properly highlighted in the listing for people who might want to know.<br/>And finally, there is a gap when you enter the house that is not apparent. Anyone needing accommodations might want to be careful with this. For able-bodies people, this is a non-issue."

I did all this through the secure AirBnB messaging. Then I noticed that the room and bathroom were dirty. By morning the heat wasn’t working and the room was at 60 degrees. Many messages later she still hadn’t gotten back to me. It took her 14 hours to respond. Most things can be rectified, but not keeping good communication, especially when you have multiple AirBnB rentals is not excusable. <br/>  In the end I had to book a Marriott for my last 2 nights, but she did reimburse me for that expense."

The apartment was great and it was helpful to have all of the kitchen amenities and parking right outside. We didn't get to explore the city, though we found a great coffee shop a few blocks down and found the neighborhood to be nice. I was concerned about the noise from the bar which is right outside the apartment, but the white noise machine completely drowned it out. It was not a detriment to our stay at all. We would definitely stay again!"

The trash bins right outside the door attract tons of flies and mosquitos which entered the property along with me, no matter how quickly I tried to close the door. There was an overpoweringly dank, animal-like odor in the bedroom and the lack of AC made for an extremely uncomfortable night’s sleep. The clutter in the entryway is not only unwelcoming but off-putting and frankly bizarre (it includes a number of dirty papers, personal photographs, coins, and random household objects like WD-40). Lastly, there was no shampoo or conditioner and the towel smelled moldy. Ultimately, not worth the bargain."

This is the kind of place that makes you realize how great Airbnb can be when the host pays attention to small details. The only “con” to mention, as others have already (and the host included in the listing description) is that the parking is a bit challenging. But once you understand how it operates, it’s workable. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it if you’re looking for a place to stay in the area."

I rented his home for a night to host a bachelor/birthday party for one of my good buddies, who simply wanted a good cut of meat and a well-made martini to celebrate the occasion.  I was initially planning to make all the food and drinks myself, but upon hearing this, Thomas went absolutely above and beyond and offered to coordinate getting us a private chef and a bartender!  The menu the chef put together for us, and the drinks masterfully mixed by the bartender, were amazing, and not having to worry about taking care of those things myself allowed me to just relax and enjoy making memories with my friends. <br/>The house and the grounds themselves are stunning, from the beautifully and artfully decorated farmhouse to the oasis of the backyard patios and pool space appointed with tropical trees and plants, you would never know you were staying in a home in the center of Albany!  We really did not want to leave the following day, which is why it was so nice that Thomas allowed us to stay a bit longer to enjoy the pool on such a hot morning. 😊   <br/>Thomas’ cohost, Delvin, is lovely.  He allowed me to check in early so I could set some things up ahead of everyone else arriving.  When I showed up, he was still in the middle of cleaning and preparing the house for us but took the time out to warmly welcome me and give me a tour of the house and accommodations.  He also stayed throughout the dinner service to assist the chef in preparing the table and clearing everything down when it was over.  It was wonderful having his company while we were there. <br/>If I could give Thomas, Delvin, their property, and this experience more than 5 stars, I would.  Highly recommend!!"

The room was bright and comfortable, I didn't use it but there is also a mini fridge. I appreciated that they provide towels, one less thing to pack. I arrived on a super hot day and the AC was up and running, which made a huge difference. It was also nice that everything in the house is labeled so there's no searching for things you need.

We also had to an inconsistent schedule this week and had to ask about extending three additional times. Peter was so accommodating and wonderful.<br/>The house had everything you needed - plenty of supplies for cleaning or replenishment.

There were a couple of guests that appeared to be a bit confused looking for the host, not sure if they were able to get in contact with them. Overall, I enjoyed the stay. The bathroom was very lovely & spacious. The breakfast snacks were offered 24/7 & included granola, yogurt, fruits, croissants, coffee, milk, orange juice, & tea."

Super affordable, great location, everything you need plus some extras (snacks!). The bed was super comfy and the pullout was well equipped for our son. We loved the park across the street and got to attend the Tulip Festival. Jake and Kate were great communicators, let us check in early and provided recommendations. We will definitely stay again if in Albany, exceeded our expectations!"

16330,52301345,368897652,2022-08-16,20954182,Sandie,"I stayed one night so this review is based on my limited time. Clude was an exceptional host: essy to talk to, immediate responses,  and level-headed. <br/>     I got to this Air with no difficulty, I did expect stairs, as per the listing. I usually travel for work but Albany is my home town city. I had a different set of circumstances; as I  just had my hip replaced then was 1 week post op agter a revision surgey. Check in was smooth but did not realize the room was 45 stairs up. I talked to Clyde who was more than empathetic. I physically could not stay there. This abode is meant for those who can ably walk up 45 stairs. Other than thar, this place is SUPERB! I has all of the original hardwood floors: the 2nd floor ballroom is a must-see, even if you don't dance. In response to the review that said there was no kitchenware: while searching for supplies I couldn't help but notice the plethora of findings. I would love to come back, albeit on a floor with less steps. But I feel Clyde has put tremendous work and love and it is felt and appreciated. An an exceptional host: I pass along my gratitude and recommendations as this Air continues to blossom"

The linens and towels were spotless, new appliances including a washer and dryer were available. Two full bathrooms also made it easy with five of us staying in the house. The rooms are beautiful and felt like hotel quality decor and thoughtfulness. (If you have any trouble with depth perception, be careful on the stairs as they’re carpeted in black.)<br/>The host was very responsive when we reached out with questions."

Jake’s place had all of the essentials we needed to cook dinner, and he was really quick to respond to messages. A really excellent stay overall!"

Nice touches with toiletries, and single brew coffee, tea, cocoa, plus spices, and kitchenware. Take note: This is a third floor with stairs only.  bedroom is not private from living room sleepers, as it is open above the wall-so light and sound are shared throughout. Beds were not very comfortable, and outlet by double bed on knee-wall side has one socket not working, so make sure phone is charging, before going to bed.  Convenient location, to downtown, with one free parking spot just around back of building from front entrance, and meter parking in front."

We appreciated how Julia made sure that the communication was honest and quick. We stayed for the purpose of going to a concert at the MVP Arena but we didn’t want to drive because of the traffic and we wanted to go hiking the next day, so being able to keep our fur baby with us, and being able to have only a 20 minute walk to and from the arena was amazing, as the hotels in the same areas weren’t pet friendly and over $250 a night. So so appreciative of the overall experience and the hosts :)"

12335,42763847,44119245,2022-07-10,46212909,Lindsay,"We stayed at Anthony’s place for a week to visit family and friends and the house was perfect for all of our needs. There was more than enough room for 4 of us and the huge backyard with deck, grill and fire pit was the highlight. We enjoyed summer nights out back grilling and roasting marshmallows in a private setting. The house is equipped with everything you could possibly need and was a cozy home vs a sterile air bnb. Plenty of kitchen items to prepare meals with and the surround sound, smart tvs, and xbox were all great to have for our family stay. The neighborhood itself is not too exciting but was quiet and super convenient to downtown, lark street, and major highways and there is a Stewart’s (convenience store) at the end of the block and plenty of food options nearby. Anthony was a super cool host, very hospitable and easy to communicate with. Would highly recommend this place if you’re staying in Albany and looking for a spacious and well equipped home that is dog friendly!"
180,1489424,461746159,2022-10-11,408815,Rayanne,The apartment was very clean and comfortable. It included the use of a washer and dryer which was an added bonus for us. There were games and books if you needed something to relax with. The family was very friendly and made us feel welcome. Great place to stay if you are in the area.

Unfortunately, the unit had a lot of electrical issues and we lost power to the smallest of kitchen appliances when we tried to turn them on. We even reset the breaker after being instructed to do so from host. It was just not the most stable electrical system. The house also had an odor of pot when we arrived. Not the biggest deal, but worth noting if you’re sensitive to these things. Overall, it was a fine stay. We were glad to have decent weather as well."

It's located directly across the street from Washington park which is a nice, calm area with plenty of restaurants within walking distance.  The apartment was clean and spacious, conveniently on the first floor. I would highly recommend it to everyone and will stay there again myself if I am in the area :) 10/10!"
9898,33558235,730602489,2021-02-12,10639460,Eduardo,"The spacious apartment was home for us for about a week and was completely what we needed. The bed and bedding was clean but the metal frame made for an extremely noisy bed. This was the case for both rooms. The apartment overall was clean and warm and the added Foosball table was great.<br/>Earl does use sound monitors that report with live data to him about the noise levels in the apartment which led to interesting automated messages from the host. After a brief back and fourth Earl explained to me how the system works and that all messages and warnings about parties where automated and not accusations. <br/>The location is very central just a few minute walk from Lark street and other trendy areas. Great time, would stay again if the need arises and would also recommend this place to visitors. But bed must be oiled! Lol"

2458,9501054,-1016980679,2023-08-04,170587965,Ben,"This basement room was perfectly located for my week of research at the NY State archives, about a 5-minute walk away (or less).  The street parking is slightly competitive, but I always found a spot.  Also, Gregg added me for a temporary parking pass, so I was good to leave me car and walk. The place is more like a hotel room than an apartment - no kitchen (though a microwave and toaster oven).  But the room was good, the value was excellent, and Gregg was helpful.  Would stay here again."

Very easy check-in and the space is bright and airy, I didn't feel like I was in a basement apartment at all. I even left my phone charger behind and Janet let me know right away and was quick to make accommodations for me to pick it up the following day. Very much appreciate their flexibility!"

Ed was very welcoming, gave a tour, & made sure all questions were answered. There was access to Wi-Fi, Netflix, even your own front porch connected to the room & more. But the best part was the super soft/comfy bed & clean room/bathroom. Kinda wish I would have stayed another night. Definitely do recommend this spot which is also right across the street from a park. Will be back soon…THANK YOU!!!"

We were a little nervous at first, but Linda assured us that on Elm and Eagle Streets, everything is very safe.<br/>The entry to this basement apartment is under the stairs. There was no light on, so it was difficult to see the lockbox code to get the key. Once inside the entry, we opened the door into the white tiled, white rug apartment. Striking contrast! We felt like we had entered a different, safe world. 😊 <br/>The floors were very clean.

A wild bird somehow entered the apartment while I was sleeping the first night. I woke up to it flying around frantically. Messaged the hosts but did not hear back from them for about 5 hours. Instead, got an automated response from them an hour later saying something to the tune of, "" Hope everything is great!"" Everything was, in fact, not great. I got the bird out myself, but it was an incredibly stressful way to start the day. When I finally did hear from them, they said ""Let us know, we can send someone to help."" I had messaged them at 8am; it was now 1pm. I told them I was dissatisfied with their response time and lack of urgency. I was expecting them to offer at the very least an explanation of how the bird got in, as no windows were open. Was really hoping for some kind of half refund for the day. Also, the ""quiet"" aspect of not disturbing guests below was tedious. Would not stay again."

It isn't sound proof and you can hear the outside door close and open but it is the city life. The unit door made us feel a little insecure as it didn't shut completely and you can see the lobby light coming through the cracks. But it did its job and kept us safe and locked in. Overall, a nice place for a weekend getaway with Diana as the host! She had great communication and was very helpful."

Lloyd was very attentive to detail and a gracious host.<br/>He provided me with all the information I needed so I didn’t even need to reach out during the stay with any questions. The place is thoroughly furnished. Kitchen has everything you need.<br/>The bed is very comfortable and I slept through the night.

Communication with the host was not sufficient in my opinion. Also, the apartment building is loud. Stomping up and down stairs at all times of the day and night, loud dogs in the building (watch over for dog waste on the stairs), and loud music. Costly Airbnb for a ok stay."

I was also thankful for the warm breakfast and lunch to go that he prepared. The room where I slept was small but adequate, with red walls and eccentric decoration. Fresh towels were tightly wrapped in plastic. The shared bathroom is down the hall. Adam visibly cares for his guests, as his meals and many reviews attest; however, the accommodations and cafe have the vibe more of an eclectic budget hostel with a few rough edges than a cozy home stay. "

I call and texted the host several times to no avail, I sat outside for 45 mins contacting Airbnb support who also couldn’t get in touch with the host! I end up sitting outside for 1.5 hours before someone finally came! This when it gets worst the person who responds wasn’t even the and had to go find a key to open the studio ! Worst experience of my life!"

The beds are comfortable, and place has a cozy ambiance. We were only staying one night to break up a long drive, so  didn't see much of the area. Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet our host, but the check-in instructions were very clear, and they responded to all our questions clearly and promptly. They were even nice enough to ship me an important item that I left behind by accident. I couldn't recommend this place more!"

The studio appeared recently renovated and the appliances were updated. The studio is a walk-up apartment located on the 3rd floor above a business; if you are an individual who struggles climbing stairs or needs wheelchair accessibility, this would not be the place for you. Despite being located above a business and on a main street, I did not have any issues with noise levels. The check in process was simple and Adem was available to answer any questions that I had in a timely fashion. Adem even left us complimentary beverages, coffee, and chocolate; a thoughtful touch. This apartment was perfect for my needs and worth the cost. I would recommend this booking."

We live 15 blocks from the last riot in Baltimore City and we are both very tuned into what Urban environments feels safe, and what feels unsafe.   This apartment is located in an area that did not feel safe.  Our GPS first took us to another street and when we finally found the apt. building, we didn't get out of the car when we pulled up to the building.  When I booked this apartment, I was not given the address until I paid for the stay.  If I had the address before I paid, I would have looked for pictures of the street on the web and would not have made the booking."

Plus it's located in a very cool historic brownstone. Sugey was a responsive and helpful host. We were very happy with the location and could explore nearby Lark Street and Washington Park. I found the kitchen to be a little understocked so if you plan to do any real cooking then you might want to bring extra supplies. Also, if plan to drive check in about parking ahead of time.

There’s a CVS close by, coffee shop and a few places to get a quick bite. The house is super easy to find and check into. I felt instantly at home and made my trip to New York so much more comfortable than expected. Very private and quiet space with a really comfortable bed and always hot shower. Hasan even let me stay late in my last day because my flight didn’t leave till later in the day! I took an UBER to the museum my first day and it was a quick 5min drive. Thank you Hasan!!!"

Sin embargo el alojamiento no es adecuado para 4 huéspedes como se describe, no era lo que esperábamos:  no tenia  sabanas para el sofá, tampoco almohadas ni toallas para 4 personas (solo 2 toallas y 2 almohadas). El sofa cama es super incomodo y muy pequeño, aun para una sola persona es incomodo. Tuvimos que dormir tres personas en la cama (la cual no es tan grande) lo que fue muy incomodo. Las cortinas al lado del sofa cama son muy claras y entra la luz solar a primeras horas de la mañana. La estadía no fue agradable. En las condiciones actuales es una alojamiento para 2 personas."

2386,9501054,-1476796972,2021-09-09,116401390,Ticia,"I really can't say enough about what a great little place this is. The houses on Madison place are all such gorgeous historic homes and Gregg's is not an exception. It is so gracious of him to open his home to people and allow them to experience some of this history. <br/>The location is amazing and located across from a small lovely park and less than a block from the Empire State Plaza as well as walking distance from both Lark st and downtown Albany. The room is lovely and very tidy. The bed super comfy and the attached bathroom very clean and all you need for your stay. There is also a small refrigerator, microwave, coffeemaker, dishes, utensils and bottled water (though Albany has great drinking water so that is just an amenity). There is a lovely antique sofa as well as other chairs for lounging. It was super easy to get in w/ the instructions that Gregg provided. <br/>I am quite baffled by the bad reviews that a couple of other people gave. There was most certainly no bad smells, it was not musty at all. It is a first floor walk in but not moist (and having lived in Albany for over 20 years I know that we have an excess of water so that is definitely a possibility). The person that mentioned creepy I feel has a very skewed view of the word creepy. It is charming and an amazing steal for anyplace. What it is Not is a new and austere hotel room. If that is what you are looking for then you probably should not be looking for an airbnb and just go to a hotel. <br/>I will be recommending this for all family and friends that are visiting the area (our bathroom is on the 2nd floor in our house so some of the elderly have some issues staying with us) and can't wait to see Gregg's other place!"

My drive into the area had me a little nervous about leaving my car on the street but once I reached this address I found it to be an adorable slice of town with eclectic restaurants within walking distance. If you're a pillow-snob like me I recommend bringing your own but other than that the space was adorable and was exactly what we needed for a quick 1-night stay!"

The apartment suited our needs as we were only in town for a few days and it was very conveniently located. It was a little loud at night however it is in a downtown location and it was not a problem for either of us. Terra quickly responded to any questions I had and I would recommend her apartment to anyone looking for a place to sleep while traveling in Albany.

I waited for a code to be generated for 1.5 hours before I could check in. After being up at 330am, traveling 3 hours for work, and working all day, I just want to go in and make dinner, not wander the streets of Albany looking for a bathroom.<br/>Concurrently to my experience, other guests with a baby arrived and were also stuck on the street for about 20 minutes, unable to access their lodgings as expected.<br/>This was needless to say, frustrating."

The building is an 1800’s brownstone which was very cool. The bed was comfy, the furnishings were very nice, the kitchen and bathroom had everything we needed and he even had water bottles in the refrigerator for us!  We felt very safe in the neighborhood and found a great little restaurant not far from there.  We’re pretty new to Airbnb, but this was a great experience and so much better than a hotel room that we’ll definitely be seeking out more Airbnb’s for our future travel!"

19988,1052962576,1576297691,2022-12-20,71212338,Tiffany,"As a travel nurse, the location was perfect to the hospitals. Its a quiet and safe neighborhood. Walking distance to restaurants, shops and entertainment. Shared living spaces weren’t clean, mainly due to a specific guest, but there was another bathroom to accommodate. Host was responsive and the assistant was great. Overall a good stay, would stay again on if I come back for another assignment."
21015,1410640329,-1422920620,2023-07-15,515541137,Takako,"The host was extremely accommodating: they allowed my early check-in. Also, the host's frequent communication about the AC unit installation process on our arrival and the following day was much appreciated!  The place is best suited for people who want to be extremely close to the medical center, VA hospital, and medical college. Despite the close distance to the emergency entrance of the hospital, evenings were quiet. We are also able to cook our own meals in the kitchen because pots/pans/tools/dinnerware were all available. Coffee capsules and teabags were also super helpful!!"

Additionally, we were able to visit my grandmother at St. Peter's with a 4 min. drive, but also still close to family in nearby towns, as well as close to the rehab facility she was moved to. The 4 members of our family (2 adults, 2 kids) here for this stay felt comfortable, with ample space, and well cared for in a well-remodeled home. Note: There is only 1 bathroom, so be mindful of one another."
1337,8915877,66677135,2016-03-24,53926974,James,"Molly's apartment was perfect for my one night stay in Albany! A short cab ride from Rensselaer Station (for anyone arriving by train or Megabus) and a short walk from Albany's downtown area, close to shops, restaurants, Empire State Plaza and the Times Union Center.  The apartment was clean and well-stocked, and Molly was even able to accommodate a late check out on short notice.  I would definitely stay here again!"

The apartment was as clean as most AirBNBs, and had lots of useful appliances.  The A/C in the bedroom wasn’t working, so when I arrived the first night, I had to sleep on the couch because the place was so hot and I arrived late (the living room A/C unit was functional).  Access to the apartment was easy and convenient, though I think the lock system recently changed (I got 3 different codes prior to arrival).  There was construction on the street that was noisy (but temporary) and took up some of the parking spots, but I had no trouble finding parking even so.  If I was coming back to Albany, I would happily stay here again.  Thanks, Brian!"

The kitchen was well stocked and even had a few extra items such as coffee, butter and eggs. This was much appreciated as we prefer to minimize eating out. Beds were comfy, including cozy comforters. Everything was very clean and tidy. We even used the backyard bbq, which was nice to have! Peter was quick to reply to any queries, including quickly solving no-wifi when we first arrived. Peter also graciously allowed us to check-out a bit later than usual, which was very helpful on our final day. Overall, it was perfect for us and we look forward to staying again when we're back visiting our son."

We had a small issue with the lock on the door and Jason was right on it to get it fixed. The apartment is clean and comfortable. Convenient location, though (as is the case with anywhere downtown) finding a parking spot was a bit of a challenge.

Beds were just flimsy simple bed frames with mattress on it. It buckled as we layed on it(very uncomfortable), could move the beds with one hand push, kitchen did not have any cooking ware, AC was not plugged in and we had to unplug another extension from a diffrent room to plug it in the AC in our room, Bathroom shower pressure is low and the water shower knob had a trick to get hot water, have to turn it opposite to the markings and stop before fully turning it. Very weird! <br/>I hope the listing managers can rectify these issues for future guests."

The furnishings include terrific mid-century touches and the Center Square area of Albany is akin to parts of Brooklyn with amazing brownstone surroundings. Prior guests commented on easy parking, though I'll admit being mindful of alternate-side (limitations for street-cleaning), I did have to circle around via one-way streets a couple times, particularly late on a Sunday evening, to find a good spot. With that said, I would -so- stay at their lovely apt. again when visiting town!"

The house was stocked with everything I could need during my 3 month stay and Chad was quick to respond to questions at all times of the day. The location is close to bus stops that provide access to downtown Albany and the surrounding area and the house itself was clean and quiet. Couldn’t ask for a better host!

We went to Albany to attend a concert at the Egg, and the venue was only a 10 minute walk away. In fact, it is about 10 minutes from the government center, the Cathedral, the Albany History Museum, and a lot of other attractions in downtown Albany. The neighborhood is very pleasant and felt very safe. Jared was very helpful in suggesting places to go, and he's done a great job making his townhouse a very pleasant place to stay. We will definitely stay there if we travel to Albany again."

I have booked with Earl a great many times and ALWAYS feel safe, due to Earls security system. All lock codes updated with each and every stay, and always feel so comfortable, as if it was my own home. Earl and his partner/associate are committed to enhanced cleaning, with each and every stay. Also, amenities included, are always above and beyond. Earl has been so easy to reach when I've needed but also truly means it when he says to contact him no matter what the time. I've dealt with a great many host's over the past couple years and Earl is one of my absolute favorite hosts to book with. I write this l, more than typical, review, as I've reviewed many stays up until now that we're a bit brief but have felt he is worthy of a much better review!"

Built in 1928, the house is updated with all modern conveniences.  The beds are comfortable, shower, dishwasher and washer/dryer work fine.   The Helderberg neighborhood is safe and close to many parks and great restaurants.  We stayed three weeks for a delightful Thanksgiving visit, and would recommend this home for long term stays (or short term – we started calling it “home” after a very short time!)."

The listing does not indicate that there are a total of four bedroom (with a possibility of a total of 8 people) for a single bathroom home.<br/>The house, especially the bathroom and kitchen, needs to be cleaned on a regular basis which was not done once during our 4 day stay. The staircase has a very strong urine smell which during a hot day because very overwhelming. <br/>The host did not make an effort to greed us at all nor talk to us or check on us during our stay. <br/>Nick was still a very helpful host when I emailed him my questions.

Provided help with the door lock and got extra towels for me when I asked. Only downfall, very sketchy neighborhood. I did not feel safe leaving my car, especially at night. Not ideal for a single, female traveler. Taking my dog out to potty before bed was very nerve racking."

Diana was so quick to respond to questions, offered great suggestions on places in town, and even went above and beyond to provide us with a DVD player for the weekend. Would definitely stay with her again if we are back in town!"

He was also always very responsive with any questions I had. <br/>The apt itself was great. I stayed at three different places on this trip, and this was by far the cleanest. I felt totally safe, even during covid. It was nice that there were plenty of dishes, both standard and disposals. Plenty of paper towels, toilet paper, cleaning supplies. Laundry in the basement was convenient. It might be nice actually if a laundry basket was provided, but we used reusable bags that we bought at Price Chopper for <br/>groceries. <br/>We came for a medical procedure that I needed done, and also had to work during the day. There is a small desk that can be used for a laptop, along with a small bar table that could be used for a laptop. There is also a folding table that I set up to use my laptop with a monitor, keyboard, etc. All of the options for work spaces were awesome!!!  <br/>The beds were so comfortable that I checked the label to see what they were. I’ve never done that before in an Airbnb! The balcony is super cute and it was nice to open the door and get fresh air. We didn’t have a car, but noticed that though the parking in the back was usually full there seemed to usually be street parking. <br/>I really enjoyed my stay here. The only thing I didn’t like was the noise. This is probably my fault, because due to booking really quickly (and not being from the area) I didn’t understand that this is essentially on a college campus. I am 39 and pretty over partying until 4am (happened probably five nights of the nine we stayed), loud music all day and night (every day) - making it difficult to work during the day, shouting and throwing things, etc. The downstairs tenants are just very, very loud. It is nothing out of the ordinary if you’re expecting to feel like you are staying in a college dorm, and Scott does provide noise machines in the bedrooms (definitely these need to be combined with earplugs if you want to sleep). If you’re going to be out during the day doing vacation like things, and partying late yourself, I’m sure this wouldn’t be an issue at all. You might even make new friends :)"

It is well stocked with a toaster, electric water heater, and coffee maker (with coffee included). The heating for the room was very quick and responsive (with the ability to set your desired temperature). Shower pressure was good. Nice big, comfortable bed. I do wish there were a few more kitchen items like bowls, forks, knives, cups, etc. It was also a little hard to cook with just a single small electric stove and only a single cooking pot (bowl?). But all in all, it was a good stay and I recommend it."

576,5651579,108822983,2016-10-17,2334011,E.,"Location is pretty good, his communication for the most part is pretty fast and informative too. Great location as described. <br/>There is a VERY lived in workspace when you come through the lower studio but he was not there during my stay. Which would be off-putting because whenever you come straight out of the studio the open workspace is right there between you (the lower studio) and the door.<br/><br/>The actual suite inside of the lower studio looked clean inside but there was like an ""old"" stuffy smell throughout when I came in. I had to Febreeze a lot and some of the smell still didn't quite go away.  Didn't smell dirty at all....just a bit weird at first. Kindo of vintage like old leather books. Maybe because of the age of the building itself? <br/>It got kind of cold to me inside as it started to get into the early evening. The heat of the building was set to 70 which is way too low imo to be a comfortable heat setting even with it being 66 outside at the time that didn't change inside it felt like it was freezing. It was extra uncomfortable when you hop straight out of the shower.  <br/><br/>All the amenities in it were great except for you have no control at all over the temperature. Kind of at the whim of the owner. <br/>I'd consider staying again ... if there's a full studio suite in the upper part of the building too. Whoever was above me at the time of my stay were not light walkers or quiet at all (from like 6:30pm to 10:30).<br/><br/>Repeat? Depends but leaning to yes ... maybe get a NEST thing or add in a way that guests who rent a full studio apartment can have control of the temperature in the studio...otherwise it gives the feel of like a big private room with a kitchen in a house and not a regular studio apartment. The temperature thing was a minor drawback but still really liked the place esp for location and price.  Or in colder weather at least provide a space heater."

Only note would be if you’re not from up north, be prepared for A/C units rather than central air! A/C units combined with car traffic on Washington ave doesn’t make the bedrooms a noise-friendly space if that is of concern."

However, we had a scheduling conflict and submitted a request to change the reservation date, which was denied because it Diana said it was ""past the window to submit."" After reading airbnb's policies, it says guests can submit change requests up until the time of check out, so I was confused about why that reason was provided. All and all, the plans worked out and we were able to stay the full stay, but it would have been frustrating if our change request was denied with little explanation why."

I found the folks in the neighbourhood to be really friendly while we were out for walks with our dog. There was a camera located in the parking area as well as the building and at no point did I feel unsafe, even when walking the dog at 11pm. This building was a former school with a lot of history. The building was clean. The unit was immaculate. Host provided everything in the kitchen we needed to cook our meals. Lark St was very close by as well as the 787 (Troy was a short 15 minute drive and highly recommend heading there to Tatu Tacos and Tequila or for the farmers market). Host was the most responsive I have encountered so far and even asked us to message when we arrived (we were coming from Canada) to let her know we made it safely. Definitely would stay at one of her units again."

Jason was very easy to communicate with and went above and beyond expectations for us. He noticed that we were traveling with an infant and offered to put a Pack n' Play in our room before our arrival even through it wasn't included on the listing when we booked. I'd definitely stay here again next time I travel to Albany!

You can safely ignore your first impression of the surroundings. Although the block seemed mostly to consist of abandoned buildings, there was nothing  scary or sketchy about the neighborhood. Kitchenware was a bit random, but luckily we didn't need to cook during our stay. We also weren't there very long due to the concert we were in town for, but the living room area was really lovely and spacious, so if you needed to hunker down for a few days, it would serve you well. The host was super friendly and responsive from booking onward—including when it turned out she'd sent us the wrong door codes. Luckily we had arrived in the afternoon (not the middle of the night, as can sometimes happen with travel). She cleared up the  mixup quickly and was very apologetic."

And her three cats! She was great about accommodating my late arrival, and went above and beyond to make me feel welcome in her comfortable home. Highly recommended for single travelers!"

However, cleaning wasn’t completely done when we got there (4pm check-in time). <br/>Diana did extend our checkout time which was nice! But it made no difference the cleaning lady was knocking on our door by 11am (normal check out time)."

Bathroom is a little crusty, dining chairs are wobbly and need tightening, a closet door that doesn’t close, windows are grimy, and the furniture and bedding felt a little cheap.  I appreciated the hosts’ prompt communications and early check in but I wouldn’t stay here again.  The space felt unloved."

As it turned out, I had to change plans last minute and only spend one night instead of two as planned and didn't find out until I work up after my first night. Earl was very accommodating to help me with my sudden change of plans and credit me for the second night when I couldn't stay."

It was very clean and organized, very spacious as well and the owner was very quick to respond to our queries. I highly recommend this place."

11506,39864828,-135694658,2021-09-20,32880220,Daniel,The place was great!  Very spacious with great places to sit and relax. The kitchen was fully furnished.  A 1 minute walk to a couple bars and restaurants where we were able to get a couple drinks and a bite to eat. The corn hole set-up was a fun way to end the night back at the place. A 15 minute drive to the airport made our last night in Albany a fun and convenient one. Would recommend to anyone.

21722,-605783537,412672698,2023-12-26,4819401,Courtenay,"Great communication, easy check in. The place is beautiful and spacious. The sitting room is great for a small gathering (family came over for appetizers). The mattresses were comfy, but the pillows were a bit flat for my taste. The bedrooms get very warm because the thermostat is in the front room with an exterior door. We had to crack the windows to be comfortable. <br/>The problem with the space, which will keep me from returning, was the loud furnace right below the bedroom. It woke me up with a start every time it kicked on (every 30 mins to an hour). I live in a city &  am used to random noises, but a loud woosh and hum right below my head was too much. I had to sleep in the sitting room, which didn't really have a comfortable place to sleep, but was better than being constantly woken by the noise of a loud furnace. My husband is deaf in one ear and my teenager could sleep through a hurricane, but if you are a moderate to light sleeper, this place isn't for you in the winter. Sorry."

There were 3 issues that we wish were aware of.... the very steep stairs to enter the 2nd floor, parking was not plentiful especially during the day where you have to move your car every 2 hours. Also the handwritten note notifying the policy of no shoes to be worn in the apartment was a surprise and inconvenient,  as the floors were quite cold and we had to put our shoes back on every 2 hours to move our vehicle."

The neighborhood and building have so much character, the apartment is very well maintained and was spotless when we arrived. Maybe this is just me, but when I walk into a new place, I have to flip every switch to know what does what. Not here! Lloyd has labeled everything and there is information posted throughout the apartment. Check-in was a breeze, Lloyd sent very detailed instructions along with pictures to help explain how to best park. (Street parking is easy on the weekends, but make sure you're aware of the posted rules otherwise. There is a public lot not far from the apt which we found easy to use and it wasn't expensive.)<br/>We highly recommend this location, we'd happily stay here again the next time we're in town!"

This was, far + away, the best air bnb experience I've ever had. <br/>First, the most important thing for me in finding a place to stay (+ what stresses me out the most) is cleanliness + whether the room will match the photos. This place is  quite literally spotless.  Cleaner than hotels I've stayed at. <br/>Second, it was welcoming and easy. I stayed at this air bnb to study for and take the NY bar exam and it could have been incredibly stressful. It was not. It's not an overstatement to say that the peace, comfort, cleanliness, and kindness I felt here directly contributed to a better performance. Justin is a national treasure + angel on earth. Thom (away when I was there) was responsive + gracious at every turn. <br/>Third, this is a great place to do literally anything in this area. I hadn't planned to return to Albany before the exam, but now hope to return this winter (so do my parents) just to stay here + explore. An asset to the community. Thank you Thom + Justin!!"

It had everything we needed and things we didn't expect - towel warmers and great tvs. The beds were super comfortable, with down comforters and lovely, soft sheets.

The place is absolutely huge yet somehow still felt homey: a well-appointed kitchen, a great bathroom with deep soaking tub, and comfy beds. Plenty of nearby spots to eat and drink -- we loved Druthers, three blocks away, and Wolff's right around the corner -- with more apparently on the way in this rapidly developing neighborhood. But be aware, it's still an active industrial area; we heard loud machinery and smelled exhaust now and again. All part of the charm for us, though!"

We walked right out the door and went and had late night food and drinks within a 2 min walk. Neighborhood seems pretty safe we parked our Jeep loaded with kayaks, coolers, and camping gear and didn’t have a single issue parked on the street. <br/>Lloyd’s communication was next level. We were coming into town right after a really bad storm and he answered all my questions about everything and made me feel great about staying at his AirBnB.

20755,1299764,1805639425,2023-07-23,521462554,Peggy,"This is a beautiful place! One of the best ever. It's easy to see why Diana is a superhost, from the cleanliness, the linens, the choice of decor and colors, the details. Wish we could've stayed a week but can't come up with another reason to head to Albany!"

2879,10768745,873081572,2021-08-17,192313910,Travis,Such a wonderful place to stay while visiting Albany! Nice little quiet place to stay while still being extremely close to everything Albany has to offer.
5598,22431640,343151529,2018-10-30,136268100,Mark,"great host, decent place, neighborhood was a bit sketchy but for two grown men it seemed to be fine. nothing to write home about, cabinets were basically empty, minimal dishware and cooking supplies. futon was pretty rough, no TV features, stereo, etc. very basic. no complaints for us, but not sure I would go back to this area of town"
14088,46894493,1506244456,2022-08-25,186301632,Susanne,Absolutely perfect! Great location close to restaurants and they give a list of local places to eat which we found very helpful. Extremely clean and comfortable! Will definitely stay again!

In addition, John is a super friendly guy, and his cat and dog are really cute. If I’m going to visit Albany again in the future, I’ll stay at John’s place."

12844,44180048,724860989,2022-06-01,110689180,Lisa,"What a great place! We loved staying here. The studio is large, with high ceilings and lots of original charm. The location is perfect. The front windows look onto a park across the street, and it's easy walking distance to lots of cool restaurants and shops. I really appreciated the detailed instructions for checking in and out, it was a piece of cake. It was insanely hot when we visited, but the air conditioning kept the apartment at a very comfortable temperature and (bonus!) provided nice white noise so we didn't hear any traffic or other tenant sounds at all. When I first sat on the bed, I thought it might be too soft. I have back problems and worry about too-soft beds. But it turned out to be one of the most comfortable beds with the most comfortable pillows that I've ever slept on. The bathroom is small, but completely adequate, and the water pressure was terrific (a little surprising for such an old building!). We would definitely stay there again. I highly recommend it."
1282,8035768,858536320,2023-12-26,446202361,Pamela,Lots of safety features! Parking was great. <br/>John met us at the house and showed us ask the fun Tips for the house. Feels like you are at a family members home! Comfortable bed. <br/>Close to hospital!

3421,11639446,768367815,2021-06-09,120300947,Sophie,"Adam was an amazing host. He stayed up late just so he could show me how to unlock the door, cooked a delicious breakfast with coffee, and offered to clean a spill that had come out of my suitcase. It was exactly what I needed for a night on the road."
21165,1126075983,946819330,2023-06-11,510381857,Nancy,Phat and Karley were gracious hosts.  Super clean environment.  Lovely backyard to enjoy AM coffee.

1106,6623339,425998979,2019-03-19,238785409,Taylor,"Terra’s place is about 5 minutes away from Times Union Center. It was a great place to stay for us because when we got out of our concert late and tired,  the apartment was just a few minutes drive away! The bed was comfortable and the apartment was clean. We enjoyed pizza for dinner right across the street. The neighborhood was not the most appealing but we felt safe in the apartment building. We also appreciated that there was a parking spot off the street for us. Over all, we enjoyed our one night stay and this place was just what we needed."
1158,6623339,642231717,2020-07-25,47936007,Steph,"Stayed here while heading north to go hiking at a few spots in the Catskills and Lake George. The location is great—lots of cute coffee shops and beer spots to fill your time. We didn't spend much time in the actual space, but it was large and open and worked out great for what we needed."

17927,-1877061162,184834609,2022-10-10,7681514,Jesse,"Clean, recently remodeled. Listing said that there was a workout room on-site, but it was still under construction when we arrived, and therefore unavailable to us. However, Peter (who was very quick with all communications) made things right for us. Location isn't great (quick drive to restaurants, etc. ) while we were hoping to walk."

We just did a quick overnight stay but the room had everything you needed. In walking distance to multiple restaurants. Overall nice stay for those traveling to Albany.

13438,45313545,769897400,2021-06-13,148449237,Kristi,"We liked our stay at Kori’s just “ok”.  Our family of four really pushed the physical space, so if you’re a couple or a single, this space will be great for you.  There is only one AC unit in the living room, and we could have used a fan to circulate the air in the bedroom during the night. The space was clean and in a good location.  Easy access to major roads and everything we did in Albany.  We also appreciated the off street parking since we were traveling with several items remaining in our car."
7920,28722270,494607524,2019-07-24,142138531,Ariana,"Clean, comfortable and conveniently located loft apartment.  Earl was quick to reply and very accommodating. We'll be booking this space again soon!"

15656,51230498,-821352464,2022-12-31,403468512,Karissa,"Our stay was nice. We felt this was exactly how the photos presented it to be and the cleanliness was great. We wished there was a light at the front door as we arrived after dark. The keypad was tough to lock when leaving but she does specify how to get it to lock and that it may be tricky. The location is right in the city so there was normal city noise, however at nighttime it appeared for us to be a bit unsafe of an environment and utilized an Uber instead of walking as originally planned. Also we were unsure of where to park, and were notified on this app in the middle of the night to move the car, which we did not see until morning time upon checking out. Thankfully no ticket or towing. Overall was great and we would stay again if we are in the area for an event."

1470,8915877,271212267,2018-05-31,67339924,Patrick,"The place was great value in a convenient location to the Capitol.  Molly was easy to work with, and I was able to check in on my own due to a lockbox.  I wasn't pleased with the number of bugs that I saw in the apartment which is why I only gave 4 and not 5 stars."

Very nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable.  Love the location and the architecture of the building and street.  Can’t say enough about the charm of this Airbnb.

Our only disappointment was that we were only there for 1 night. But that was bc that’s all the time we had to stay. Nothing to do with David or the place. I highly recommend the place and David as a host! He is very accommodating and responsive. Thank you David! We wish we didn’t have to leave."

The apartment is really cute and cozy, perfect for the three of us. Super-clean, too. There is a washer/dryer and a sauna available. It was way too hot for a sauna, but we have the same one and in the winter love using it. There's a bunch of good food close by. The directions for checking in were really easy, and we were all tired, so it was nice to just let ourselves in/check ourselves out. Great stay, and a really kind and hospitable host."
2712,10768745,472375333,2019-06-19,13596338,Neal,"Liz's place is a sweet very affordable quiet room with a private bath.  The neighborhood is quiet and green and Liz was a responsive host.  It is in a lovely old home stylistic character and charm.  <br/>It was  listed as having a kitchen which does not feel accurate to me. There is a fridge, a microwave, a electric kettle to boil water but no option for pan boiling or sauteing and very minimal utensils (ex. no cutting board or cooking knives, dining plates).  It also has no sink separate for the bathroom hand washing sink which would be insufficient for washing up after cooking a real meal.  The place seems set up for heating up already prepared food but not for preparing food from ingredients."

I would definitely stay there again."
13173,44265426,2076473066,2022-10-06,241375963,Dustin,"Lloyd's place is very nice for the area and is in a good location right next to the park. <br/>Communication was very good which was important as there was another guest in my place upon arrival. Thankfully he had another unit that was clean that I could stay in adjacent to the original. It sounded like an honest mixup, but I felt uneasy as my door code wasn't reset and I had to use the ""master"" during my stay. I'm not sure if this was the same case for the other renter. <br/>Other than this it was a very pleasant stay. he handled the situation very professionally. <br/>Would consider renting from him In the future."

Janet was very kind and friendly. There is a seperate entrance, which increases the sense of space and privacy, as well as access to a lovely garden. The bed was extremely comfortable and everything was very clean. Great selection of channels on the TV and good strong wifi. The location is lovely - a quiet and picturesque street, just a block away from excellent restaurants, cafes and bars. Found a great bakery in the morning for breakfast as well.  Excellent public transport connections from the bus and train stations. The listing was excellent value for money as well, part when compared to the cost of local hotels. Highly recommended."

There was a warm, welcoming aroma to greet us and little treats and things of interest throughout the home. We are a family of 10 adults and we had more than enough space. The neighborhood is lovely and just perfect for leisurely strolls. This home is definitely on my favorites list! Thank you Diana for a wonderful weekend!"

The apartment is in a very nice neighbourhood of Albany and I found to be quite safe, even at night.  The bed was extremely comfortable, to a point that I missed my alarms and my train back to NYC haha!  Although I didn't meet Terra, her communication was impeccable and would happily stay at the property again.  My only concern was that the WiFi was pretty poor and I found that the signal was better when you were further away from the router which is strange, something which probably needs to be addressed.  Apart from that it was awesome!!"

Staying at your place was the best first experience, with AirBnB, that we could've imagined. The company should sincerely reward you, because they now have lifetime customers, simply because you were our first experience.  No matter how ""crappy"", any other hosts and properties, might possibly be, in our future, and in other locations, you will be the, ""minimum"" 5 star standard, that we will hold, hosts and properties to, as we explore the AirBnB world, for our future travel needs. Again, Earl and Floanne, a heartfelt THANK YOU !! <br/>Sincerely Samuel A. Roesnergilles and Sarah Rayburn."

Adam's place is an incredible bargain, the value cannot be beat. He is perfectly located for Albany - very central. While the rooms are small and very basic, in an old house and you'll have communal bathrooms, they'll do just fine. They are clean and he provides 3 meals/day; you'll get a bag lunch if you are out. If you like to try different cuisines, are health conscious and want a friendly, more than accommodating host and particularly if you are on a budget, this place is for you. Adam himself is older, but very intelligent. His passion is what he is doing now and he enjoys it. If you visit, you will read many of the notes others have left behind and it will lift your spirits in mankind! I definitely recommend it!"

I will admit to being a bit surprised by the area, which is walkable to downtown Albany but is definitely going through some gentrification. The building itself appeared to be a bit rundown but we were pleasantly surprised by the actual Airbnb which was perfect.

The apartment is in an accessible location yet so quiet that you don't feel as if you are downtown. The outdoor space at the back of the home was definitely one of my favorite features of the place. Check in was incredibly easy, Earl was very responsive at all times, and the space was spotless and equipped with everything we needed. We did not have to ask about towels or pillows, etc. You can tell that Earl really cares about this property and spends the time needed to ensure it feels just like home.

You can hear people in the hallway since the apartment is located right at the front door. We felt safe and secure. Yes, the neighborhood is lower income, but there were 0 issues. Residents were polite.  The instructions for getting into the apartment were incorrect. Diana wasn't very professional when I was explaining that the codes were not working. More than once she said we were doing something wrong and questioning my reading comprehension skills. She finally realized she provided the wrong codes in the listing and texted what I imagine were the check in instructions I should have received originally but did not. She didn't apologize until I said hey you could've just listened to me originally instead of talking down to me. Nice place, but wouldn't come back after that interaction."

6340,24655782,671161069,2020-10-04,203401251,Vicky,"The space was good enough for two people. It was clean especially the bedroom and bathroom. The linens & towels smelled amazing. Unfortunately, we did not use the sauna/laundry room but we did had access to it.  <br/>The host did mentioned that we may hear noises from other apartments but I did not expect it to be so loud especially the apartment above us. The weird thing was that the apartment above us would walk/run very heavily between the hours of 7am to 10am, but during the evening starting like 5pm into the night, there was hardly any noise. <br/>There were a bit minor hiccups that can be corrected in the kitchen area such as the appliances being a bit unclean, but nothing too major.<br/>It took about a 10 minute walk to get to Lark Street where food, bars, and other stores were located. <br/>Overall, the stay was a great location for us. Parking was always easy to find and it was also close to many restaurants  & stores. <br/>Thank you again, Jake for allowing us to stay."

5473,22398196,512778508,2019-08-18,109853130,Sylvie & Etienne,My husband and I had a great time at this home. It was very quiet that no one could tell that there were other guests in the other rooms. Very clean home.. But just one thing we had issue was with the bed it was a little too small for us it diocese feel like a queen size bed and it was a hard mattress. But overall the place was fantastic and the best part is the parking driveway in the back of the house. We will definitely come back to stay here.

Much easier than having to sit in the surrounding traffic. <br/>Earl’s loft was very clean. It is supplied with extra amenities in case you forgot something. Snacks if you need them too! <br/>The only downfall (which he advertises) is that the walls are thin so you do hear other guests. It did not effect our stay too much. You could just hear other people walking around their rooms. <br/>His communication was great. He was speedy with all his responses. If I were to find myself in Albany again, I would certainly say here again."

There is even a small fitness room.  It worked perfect for our three-generation family.  My grandson had the basement bedroom and family room. My daughter and her husband had one of the bedrooms on the main floor.   My wife and I had the upstairs bedroom, bathroom, and fitness area to ourselves.  The kitchen is well stocked and fairly large.  The kitchen table holds six people.  There is a large TV on the main floor, and a small TV in the lower floor and upstairs.  The house has a small driveway that could hold three cars.  There is nice outdoor seating, but we didn't utilize it in January.  The house is very close (walkable) to SUNY Albany along with several restaurants and drug stores.  We will definitely consider staying again when we need a place in Albany."

The place is close by from the train station and was even more beautiful that pictures. The living room and bedroom were extremely clean and spacious. The private bathroom was very nice and clean as well. Phat and Karley were responsive and so kind, offering to give us a ride to and from the train station.

The decor blew me away the second I walked in!  : O<br/>Location is superb and comfortable for walking to Downtown/Central Ave/DelawareAv.  Communication and instructions were detailed and comprehensive (you almost can't go wrong when you know what to expect/follow : D ).  As for the area I found it to be quite vivacious and alive; KNOW YOURSELF, if you are not comfortable in this kind of district, find what YOU need; otherwise you should be fine and feel pretty safe!  ; )  CONCLUSION:  My only regret was not being able to stay even LONGER.  : D  Kudos+Thank you!"

It’s equivalent to a large hotel room in size but much homier and has a kitchenette area with amenities and a full size fridge etc. The entry to the house and access to the room is easy and private as well. Elizabeth was a responsive host and provided clear and prompt instructions about arrival. <br/>The furnishings are all very comfortable and the space has lots of character (in the best possible sense).  Definitely recommend this rental for 1 person or a couple spending a day or two in Albany.

The place is beautifully furnished, the apartment was heated to a comfortable temperature, despite the frigid temperatures outside.  This implied forethought and concern for our wellbeing.<br/>There were power strips conveniently located in the living room.  Since I was on a business trip, that was important because I had several devices.  The bedroom was comfortable, with extra heaters.  We didn’t use the kitchen, but it was clean and had the things we needed for an overnight stay.  The shower was clean, easy to use and had plenty of towels.<br/>Brian communicated with me throughout the entire process; from the booking to check-in and after our stay.  Amazing job, Brian!"

We were overwhelmingly pleased with how luxurious it felt for the price, which we don’t often get to enjoy on our tight budget. Diana was quick to respond to messages and the check in was easy and smooth. Thank you for a great Albany experience!"

Upon our quite late arrival, the family was still up and were busy with home beer preparation. It seemed that own business took all their attention, so we kind of felt on our own. Basement where we stayed was spacious, but quite messy, all things spread around, especially in the adjacent rooms. The room itself and the shower was ok; one can stay overnight there."

16772,52691284,-1734178329,2023-12-25,52970252,Sarah,"Diana’s place exceeded our expectations! The pictures didn’t do it justice. It was incredibly spacious and a great size for what my family and I needed. My only drawback was the leak from the 2nd floor ceiling caused by the 3rd floor shower. The host was notified and responded by saying that it will need to be looked at. However, no one came to check it out during our stay. It was unfortunate that we couldn’t use it because it resulted in 9 people sharing one shower on the 2nd floor. Other than that, we had a pleasant stay. Diana’s holiday touches did not go unnoticed. My family was blown away by the exquisite Christmas tree in the living room, especially given that we all brought gifts to exchange and had somewhere to put them. Overall we truly enjoyed our weekend."

16506,52569714,231868764,2022-12-05,415279786,Andrew,"Diana was a wonderful host and a lovely person. Unfortunately, the apartment was less than perfect. The upstairs flat smelled like marijuana from the adjacent room, the floors were dirty and the neighbors were quite loud. I was hesitant to leave my girlfriend alone in the apartment because the neighborhood appeared a little sketchy. During our stay, there wasn't much hot water, so we couldn't use the lovely bathtub provided for us. Apart from the few items mentioned, the apartment was decorated with highly contemporary accents and was very spacious. Lastly, the room had very comfortable furniture and the amenities were a great plus. I wouldn’t let these few things deter you from staying at one of her apartments, Diana is still a really kind host who values her guests."
15080,50171851,-1012329325,2021-08-17,45835151,Kip,"This was such a lovely little garden apartment. Todd and Pan thought of everything, from a variety of coffees and creamers to fragrant flowers in the private garden! It was spotlessly clean and felt fresh as well as cozy and personal. The location is great, a couple blocks from the Capital Center and part of an historic brownstone neighborhood filled with hip little shops, cafes and restaurants. Todd responded instantly with my questions and was so gracious. Our experience staying here was the best of what one expects from an air BnB."

It’s an old school renovated into apartments but you cannot tell at all inside the flat. It’s gorgeous and spacious. Great for a large party if needed. Natural lighting, fun actives, excellent lounging area, operational kitchen, and THE BATHROOM. The jacuzzi tub is killer. On top of Diana being quick with the replies, the details provided are impeccable. Highly, highly recommend."

Everything was straight forward from my first contact. And they even arranged for me to use a different room at a lower cost. The two of them were also very welcoming and fun to chat with.
21675,-1303041265,1954670354,2024-03-08,17224232,Alva,FS is a great host. The skylight in the bathroom channels the sunlight well making your shower time feel invigorating. The location is near several major bus lines and main roads with restaurants and shopping areas in a residential neighborhood. Easy to get around from his place if you don’t have a car. Thumbs up

10186,34330970,609292033,2020-02-22,89754538,Franchesca,"The space itself was perfect! Really cute and spacious. SUPER close to the Capitol, public transit, a liquor store, etc. <br/>It is NOT in a sketchy neighborhood as other reviews have insisted. The apartment is a *block* away from a precinct. The neighborhood is residential, close to the downtown ""bustle"", and is occupied by black and brown bodies. If THAT makes it sketchy (cause I can't see what else would) then check in with your bias. <br/>That being said, I marked 4 stars for these reasons:<br/>1) I contacted the host about where to park after I was sent 3 pictures of a parking lot (which had alot of spaces in it). I called the host, was met with an odd/flippant attitude, and told that I should park in the spot that matched my unit number (as if this was self explanatory... I didn't even notice the parking spots were painted with numbers.). The verbal interaction was strange. All other correspondence occurred via text from there on out. <br/>2) There were hairs in between the pillows of the bed in the master bedroom. The sheets themselves were clean, but seeing someone else's hair made me feel as though the bed sheets were washed but not the pillow cases which was a bit unsettling. Everything else was VERY clean so this was confusing. <br/>3) Despite two seperate efforts and reaching out to the host for further instruction, I couldn't get the jacuzzi tub to be operational. Not sure if it just doesn't work, or if I was doing something wrong, but it was a big selling point for me for selecting this apartment so that was a let down. <br/>All in all, I would absolutely stay here again! It was a beautiful apartment and an okay value for what you pay per night. 👍🏾"
11464,39864828,745517278,2021-04-04,104494134,Fiona,A very great space to stay!  The neighborhood wasn't the quietest spot (train horns in the early morning); however as a city-dweller that wasn't a huge issue for me.  I more so enjoyed the beauty of the apartment --which was above and beyond cool!

Street parking conviently right outside the side the door! Has fans, an AC that keeps it a comfortable temperature. And the key pad door locks make it really nice for easy acess so you dont have to remember a key when you leave. And definitly a more than reasonable price!"

17536,54126420,-1374228519,2023-04-17,397253946,Logan,"Nice place, good value. It is small but much bigger and better than a hotel room. <br/>Initially, it was a bit difficult to find and be sure that I was in the right place. This is mostly because I'm from an area where we don't have many multi-apartment homes, so I wasn't quite sure what I was looking for. No matter, Erion was extremely responsive and communicated clearly and thoroughly. <br/>I did have one small issue over my stay, but again, the host was very responsive to messages and it was addressed quickly. <br/>The location is very close to a great grocery store, restaurants, and the hospital where I was doing a clinical rotation at, which is why I was staying there. <br/>Overall, nice place. Worth the price, had everything I needed in-house, clean and tastefully decorated. Also, the bed is super comfy."
17372,53567589,-939460465,2023-10-31,11258347,Josh,"This garret in the heart of one of America's great forgotten cities was perfect for getting to know the town. A night stroll put me in mind of Ironweed (filmed up the block) and the historic brownstones have a charm all their own. Convenient to highways, Washington Park, the museum, and great nightlife, this little apartment was perfect for our needs. Brian was a terrific host, communicative and polite. Highest rating."

The BNB was clean and spacious with multiple rooms and up to date amenities for cooking and cleaning as needed. The house is under renovations yet practically unnoticeable as Allen (host) has taken steps to outline the positives of living quarters while keeping the surrounding areas free of debris and construction elements as to not hinder our experience. The house offers back lot parking space and street parking as needed. Allen is a super host and took all measures to ensure our stay was his highest priorities, we'll will defiantly book our stay here again once the world opens back up for us to enjoy all the surrounding area has to offer. 5☆!!!"

3482,11639446,-1415759670,2023-10-28,155937663,Luther,"I was in Albany for a statewide advocacy conference. Out of all of the Airbnb locations I have stayed in between Albany, Schenectady, and Troy, Adam's place was above-and-beyond. He was very helpful and caring, and he is absolutely prompt on his responses and his checking-in on everything from the first day to the check-out time. As an added bonus, he delivered more than just breakfast two days in a row. The meals he brought to me on both mornings were so amazing and plentiful (couldn't even eat all of it during my stay due to so much food at the conference), I even bought the leftover food he made home with me that I could even eat while I am at work back in my hometown. For such a very low price, the location, and for everything, this is certainly a place I would recommend anyone when visiting New York's capital region or surrounding areas.  Looking forward to reserving his place again if needed. Thanks, Adam, for everything."

The amount of accommodations available were so shocking that we couldn’t believe it. There’s a wide variety of available 2 player and over games for entertainment. The tv in the living room is below a nice electric fireplace for a nice romantic atmosphere with adjustable lighting. For those, who may want to know they have an available ironing board, white noise machine, humidifier, blow dryer, and a hair curler. 😁"

A great location to stay close to do your Albany business but use your street smarts and keep your guard up. Earl is fantastic, he will guide you."

18264,1585263244,1008656783,2022-10-16,8647165,Nikki,"The pictures don’t do this place justice, as it’s a lot nicer in person! Check-in was easy, Brian was very communicative, and also responsive to our scheduling and needs. The place is a great location on Lark st, and next to the park, which was great for our two dogs. For those with dogs that don’t want to walk to the park, we found a open church with a grass lawn down Hamilton street which was closer (assuming you also pick up after your dogs). Ample street parking on street or nearby blocks, just have to pay attention to the signs on the weekdays. So many restaurants nearby, especially for vegans. Also, the king sized bed is very comfortable! Looking forward to our next stay."
15658,51230498,-1721908735,2023-01-22,176829516,Ashley,Very clean and comfortable little spot! Sonya was very responsive and proactive with instructions! You can hear people very clearly from the outside but the atmosphere of the AirBnB puts you at ease and it's easy to relax!

17895,54369240,569353257,2023-09-04,521978648,Michael,"It was a very nice clean establishment, that I would recommend to friends. My only negative responses was that it was not clear to me that there are a lot of stairs, and the the outside ones are a bit steep.  You do occasionally get some street noise from police or ambulances (?) but none of which was easily audible in the bed room, nor did the noise wake me."
4143,16531782,518100549,2023-01-02,226430332,Emma,"This was a lovely place filled with everything we needed.

Super clean, parking wasn’t terribly difficult, ( Checked in after 6<br/>PM on a Monday)  The stay was great and everything as described! I felt like the neighborhood had a great charm, almost like a small piece of Brooklyn!"
2483,10768745,74603559,2016-05-16,45239367,Yifan,Elizabeth is really nice and hospitable. She gave me a very warm welcome when I got there. Her place is in a park and the environment is very good. The room is very large and comfortable with a private bathroom. There is also a parking place. This is the place you want to spend the rest of life in.
16033,51960331,-440590821,2022-10-28,405341,Bryan & Marisa,Very convenient to walk downtown to the show we were there to see. We walked over to their restaurant as well for a quick drink & wish we could’ve have time for dinner! Very quaint and great for a short stay! Thanks!

The location is convenient, walking distance to many shops and restaurants and Washington Park. It is on a busy street but we did not notice any noise. The bedroom is in the back and away from street noise anyway. The bed was very comfortable. Brian the host was very responsive and accommodating. He helped to make the stay enjoyable. We would definitely stay here again."

Within a very short walk there were several nice restaurants and this is terrific when you do not want to get back into your car to have a nice meal. The hosts were very kind and accommodating.

There is quite a few stairs to the room. The room is spacious and comfortable but It is chilly upstairs. I ask to her adjust the heat and she did. I will stay there again.

This apartment had all the things we needed to just hang out - a pool table, a big couch and tv, arcade game -- we used it all!  Diana provided all the instructions and communication we needed to get in and get comfortable right away! We were grateful for the warm welcome into this clean, fun, downtown apartment."

8523,28868857,532323192,2019-09-19,21253070,Bianca,"This is my first time staying in the basement, my third time staying in Earl's building. It's perfect for a couple nights, for a single person, or a couple. I would not have anyone sleep on the couch however, just because it is super low to the ground. The place was spotless. When I arrived, the internet was down, I contacted Earl and he messaged me, then actually called me within a few minutes to give me advice on how to fix it. My only complaint, that is not a deal breaker, the bathroom is outside of the apartment with a wide open area of nothing but hallway. Also, thinking safety (as I always am), there are two exits, but they are pretty much right next to each other. I know its hard to change an old building, especially with the bars on the windows for safety as well. It's just something to be aware of. I will still be staying here for the remainder of my semester, so it is not stopping me! I just want everyone to be prepared!  Please book this place though! Perfect walking distance to Times Union, the Palace Theatre, the museum, and practically anything downtown. I bet you won't find anything cheaper!"

Diana’s home was spotlessly clean, is centrally located in Albany, and was very comfortable. Diana left clear instructions and was very responsive. Highly recommended."
5673,22431640,472857823,2019-06-20,231852551,Jamie,"I was in Albany to take a grueling 3 day test and wanted something quiet and private. This was a about a 5-10 minute safe walk to Albany Med Center, and much cheaper than the suggested hotel. It's so close to Center Square, the museum, and several parks. I only had to Uber to the airport and back, otherwise I walked everywhere. The apt itself is very clean and cozy, I almost forgot I was away from home a few times. Didn't need to get anything but groceries for a few days, although there are mounds of places to eat nearby.  I loved the special touches to show that the host is environment friendly and cares about natural products.  There was just enough to do locally so I could unwind after crazy days but not so much that I was overwhelmed. And the apt is perfect for kicking back on the couch and watching Netflix, too. I'm a runner and had no problem knocking out 2-3 miles a day through the local streets and parks. Jake was very quick to answer any questions I had and the virtual guidebook was very helpful. Slept great, would stay there again in a heartbeat if I had to return to Albany. Thanks!"

Very convenient location as I was visiting at St Peters hospital which is only a few minutes away. Place isn’t fancy but it was clean and has everything needed (including a small but reasonably well equipped kitchen), and the bed was comfortable. Living room area has nice couches and a big screen tv with streaming services. WiFi was decent. Had a small issue getting in, but Erion was very responsive and took care of it within a few minutes. Would definitely stay there again if I need to come back."

Close to the little shopping area on Madison Ave. I was a little startled to see the bathroom was outside the studio, but I probably just didn't read the other reviews closely enough to realize that ahead of time.

Also, I was traveling alone, and after talking with people (post-trip), I realize the best AirBnB experiences are when you go with others, so things like problems with the lock (I couldn't lock the door, and then when He fixed that, I couldn't get in because I didn't know the new code) that are frightening on your own, would be no big deal with friends to help figure things out. (And again, after talking with friends, I've learned that problems with locks and keys are probably the most common complaints about AirBnBs.) That said, He was a welcoming and responsive host. He replied to messages requesting assistance within the promised time frame, and was considerate and helpful. This apartment is a large, lovely  space that would be great for 2-3 people to share."

Needing to sleep during the day, as a night shift travel nurse, Diana went above and beyond to be accommodating to my needs. She was sweet enough to go out and buy blackout curtains just so I could get a better sleep during the day and was very accommodating to my specific check in  needs. Plenty of extra blankets, walls decorated beautifully with Diana’s artistic touch, and the place even comes with a cool friendly cat. I look forward to many more stays at Diana’s."

I was a little surprised that the apartment I was assigned (#5) was not the ""stunning"" one advertised and pictured.   Unit #5 appears much less modern and less refined than the one in the photos.   However, this is more of an observation than a complaint.<br/><br/>The apartment was clean, bright and had all of the basics required for a one night stay.   It's central to everything and right across the street from Washington Park with many restaurants nearby.   On site, off-street parking was a really nice perk in this busy city where parking is very limited.   <br/><br/>Though I did not meet Terra, she was a perfect host - snappy replies to questions and check-in and check-out was a breeze.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Her instructions were very clear to enter the ground-level suite, and I could quickly enter by using the lockbox even though I arrived at 10 pm. The spacious suite has a comfy couch and ample living space to spend your downtime when you are not in the bedroom. The bedroom has lots of natural light and a comfortable bed. The bathroom is quite large and supplied with all the essentials that you need. The neighborhood is safe and walkable to several great cafes (Stacks espresso makes an impressive flat white - a 4-minute walk) and restaurants (Iron Gate Cafe - a 7-minute walk). I highly recommend staying at Janet's place."

He had all the instructions spelled out in a message that I didn't know about,  not his fault at all! The place is so welcoming and clean and a walk to the corner will provide restaurants and a grocery store. That was appreciated after a 5 hour drive and tour of the Capital building. It was a very pleasant stay, and affordable. I highly recommend Erion's place, for location,  awesome amenities and welcoming atmosphere."

Diana had all the extras available, that was definitely an added bonus. Great location, not far from anything, but not close enough to be in the midst of it all.

Will definitely be looking to book Queen’s place the next time I come to Albany. It was walking distance to downtown and in a very convenient location to other points of interest.

We stayed at his home for a month while receiving medical care and this home was the most peaceful place to come back to and rest. Any time we needed anything Timothy was quick to take care of it. His son even gave a little dinosaur toy to my toddler before we left because he heard he loved dinos. The home is huge! We didn’t use the top floor much but the kids loved to go up and run around. Bedroom floor was comfortable and spacious. My toddler is already sad to leave his “fishy bed.” The first floor is very spacious, living room large and comfortable. Roku TV with lots of options. Bathrooms on all floors. Laundry available in basement was so nice to have. A beautiful old house that was a solace to us during a very difficult time. We are grateful for Timothy, his family, and our time at “Albany house.”"
15704,51230498,1212570861,2023-07-31,492923200,Gabriella,"There are a lot of instructions and house rules to read through, and some of the information conflicts. For example, being instructed to remove linens from the bed and place them in a hamper in the bathroom vs being instructed to leave them on the bed. Instructions to immediately remove shoes upon entering, instructions for how to use the shower correctly, ect. All of these requests are reasonable for someone who wants to maintain their property, but it definitely takes away from your ability to relax after a long trip. Also, there was a coffee pot available to use, but no coffee. <br/>This does not reflect the host in any way, but the neighborhood is questionable in terms of safety, especially at night. As a female traveler I was approached and/or cat called several times and felt it necessary to keep pepper spray close at hand. This is not a complaint, but a comment to inform future travelers. <br/>Otherwise, Sonya's place was clean and as described."

I just really loved this place.  Terra was quick to reply and accommodating.

1219,7563949,417533357,2019-02-27,7324795,Mark,"While serviceable for my overnight stay, I would hardly characterize this place as a ""gem"".  Rather, it's funky at best (which may work for some and potentially for me in some circumstances), and the neighborhood rather run down with not many amenities beyond a local bodega.  I had to check myself in, and the front door did not work well/easy, either opening or closing.  There was no separate key left for me for the room I stayed in, so I had to take my valuables (laptop) with me when I went out for the evening.  When I came back later, there was no outside light so that I could not see to operate the front door lock mechanism, and had to use the light on my smartphone.  I stayed there over a cold winter night, and the room was quite cool and drafty, despite (not enough) heat being provided.  The bed had a thin duvet for the time of year and there were no extra blankets, so I had to sleep in layers of clothes with a scarf and hat on.  Also, the venetian blinds on the windows were broken so they could not be opened to let outside light in.  All that said, the shared bath was quite well stocked and warm, but I had to always flush the toilet twice to fully empty it.  Finally, the room only had a television that worked for online streaming assuming you had accounts (like Netflix) already set up and laptop and a bluetooth device.  I would likely not stay here again, and I think the place is over-priced given what it is."
431,3820211,224244642,2018-01-02,69097481,Tara,We loved that this apartment is in an old precinct station and the location is perfect.  It was super easy to uber everywhere when we weren't walking.  It was a really nice stay!

It was very clean and comfortable The coffee in the morning and ice for our cooler before we hit the road was helpful.<br/>Parking street signs are a bit confusing so getting to park in the driveway was important. We would stay here again if coming to the Albany
4982,20633175,756743446,2021-05-09,96662497,Jonathan,"All was well until I walked to my car to retrieve some water with an unlit cigar in my mouth. After seeing me in the window, James rang our doorbell and felt as if he needed to remind us that this was a ""no smoking"" premises. When there was clearly no smell nor smoking, he would peer through our window whenever walking up the stairs. We had to close the blinds. James later requested we pay a $50 for cleaning fee because of a strong ""cologne"" smell. When I called Airbnb to dispute the charge, the agent agreed that this was a preposterous claim. I realized that James's issues with us stemmed from something a little deeper than what was on the surface. Brothers beware!!! You know that ""feeling"" when you encounter it."

10795,36443605,595711113,2020-01-20,84507866,Garin,"Elizabeth was a lovely host.  Her place was stylish, comfortable and clean.  There were many thoughtful touches throughout.  In particular, we found the beds to be comfortable.  Additionally, Elizabeth was kind, helpful and very quick to respond to our numerous requests during the trip.  The biggest issue we had was that because the apartment is in an old building, we could not control the heat in the apartment.  It was uncomfortably hot in there at times and we had trouble sleeping with the heat.  Elizabeth did respond and try to solve the issue, but this was a factor that made our stay less than ideal.  It’s also important to note that the apartment is on a Main Street and we heard music playing loudly through the night, though I can’t say if that was due to the busy street or just someone’s apartment in the building or a neighboring one."

So the chance to contemplate the passage of time before and after the gathering was very welcome.<br/>The room itself echoed the ambience of the era but had all the conveniences the intervening decades have devised.   <br/>So really glad I found it & will happily stay there whenever I can get back."

Also, be warned that while you have the studio, you are still very much in a shared house with other apartments (we struggled with the the doors and getting our bags in when arriving and the next afternoon we were encouraged to be more careful about the doors slamming in a note left on the door). This is a shared space, know that the other folks in the building are paying attention to you!"

We also appreciate the the decor in the bedroom it was BEAUTIFUL and very unexpected!!! Unfortunately,  there were concerns. There were areas of the apartment that were never cleaned that my partner and I had to clean including the toilet that I bought to your attention and the fact that the bathroom had an odor. Also, It felt a bit unsanitary using a plunger to unclog the jacuzzi. It was a task filling the jacuzzi, the hot water kept running out, we had to boil water just to keep the jacuzzi warm especially  since we couldn’t get the jets to work. The microwave was also extremely dirty. The dishes and pots that were supposed to be clean had dried food on them. The extra comforter that was set aside in the closet was very itchy and covered in hair to the point where we couldn’t use it. We wouldn’t have needed the extra comforter but the temperature kept dropping on the thermostat. The TV remote we could not find where you said it would be until a day later where it was found deep in the couch cushions. The apartment has alot of unknown of with noises throughout the night that can keep you awake if you are a light sleeper like myself. To make matters worse I reached out to the host to resolve the issues and she did absolutely nothing. Although we had some highlights we missed out on the main amenities that drew us to book."

It's also in a very good location : a few blocks away from both downtown and the city hall with good access to the highway if needed. The host is also very responsive. Only thing to keep in mind is that due to its proximity to the highway, it is not ideal for very light sleepers. Other than that, everything was perfect from check-in to check-out."

Jared ensured a smooth check-in, has a lovely place that is clean and comfortable, and in a really awesome area of town. <br/>Parking is free but on street and first come, first serve — we got lucky, but something to keep in mind as you plan your trip! We didn’t want to lose our prime spot so we ventured out and about via the local bus route and it was perfect and so easy.<br/>Extra touches like snacks and water were so appreciated.<br/>Three adults and two kiddos had plenty of space in this charming old home, and if the weather were slightly warmer, I absolutely would have been enjoying the deck/balcony with a cup of coffee or glass of wine!<br/>Great stay and a wonderful host. Thank you!"

11420,39836487,-769883778,2023-11-20,392179742,Jordan,"Overall, the place was not too bad. The size was perfect and we really didn’t spend too much time there as we were out and about. The things that really off put me were that the bathroom didn’t seem quite clean. There was mold in multiple places that I could see. I also wasn’t a fan of the toilet leaning against the wall because you basically also had to sit right up the that wall while using it. There was a stain on the bed spread as well. If you’re a woman traveling alone, you likely won’t feel very safe walking around this location after dark. As for parking, you just have to find somewhere and walk over. Sometimes we found really close spots, other times we went quite a while."

Throughout our stay, Sean checked in to make sure everything was going okay. prior to eveb arriving, he had suggested some wonderful places to eat and places to see. The only forwarning is the parking. if you find a place to park on the street, you must move your car every 2 hours. We were able to find a garage within walking distance. The good news is, you really don't  need your vehicle because so many amazing restaurants and bars are within walking distance from his place.  We enjoyed our little get away and will definitely be staying again when in the area."

We enjoyed Elsa's beautiful yard with red and yellow maple leaves the perfect fall decoration.   It was fun to walk around  the neighborhood and admire the houses, gardens and parks. We were near plenty of fun restaurants along Madison in one direction  and New Scotland with St. Peter's Hospital in the other. We hope Elsa and Lloyd will let us stay again"

Supplies—paper towels and bath towels—were lacking and a sink fixture had been broken before we arrived, giving the impression that a third party had failed to provide the appropriate services. We notified the host who immediately apologized and respected our request to look at the sink after we left. Overall we had a good experience."

4724,20519807,239621178,2018-03-02,154377057,Michelle,"Michael's place was as advertised and to be honest the pictures are modest of the place but once you get in the house you realize it's a slice of heaven! Never have I been to an Airbnb where everything is literally at left for the guest to control. The space was graciously adequate, bathrooms immaculately clean, kitchen, living room etc. It was awesome that Michael even provided laundry soap and detergent to wash clothes, the first Airbnb host who I came across that provided that and I was thankful. The house felt very warm and welcoming each evening I arrived from work and I loved the fact that I could turn the heat up to any desired temperature to feel comfortable. The toiletries his wife Freida thoughtfully put together was outstanding, the ginger soap smelled heavenly. My bed that I slept in was comfortable at night and the linnen was very clean and warm that was on the bed, there was even a second set of comforters in the room's closet, an iron provided, clean rags and towels, shampoos and conditioners.....I mean what could ask for more. On my first night in Michael was kind enough to offer me a ride from the Greyhound bus to his home, which I was so greatful for as I often arrive later in the night and often have to take Lyft to get to most of my host's homes. His hospitality didn't end there, sitting on the dinning table there was an abundance of fresh fruits which Michael told me and his other guest we could feel free to eat whatever from the bowl of fruits.......the grapes were deliciously sweet! Michael checked in almost daily to make sure everything was to my liking. I did get a chance  to meet his wife Freida but I am sure she is just as awesomely gracious and kind as he.  This place deserves a 10! I would recommend anyone staying in the Albany area to book with their stay here it was worth every dollar. Did I forget to mention that they are right on the 13 and 138 bus line and right by St. Peters  Hospital......I got to work on time and easily from their location.   Now Michael is what I consider a ""Super Host and it is host like him and his wife that make being away alot more comforting while away or on business.....I wish them all the best!"

Rosie was a fantastic host, great communication and just genuinely interested in making sure I had everything I needed. The location is fantastic, loved taking daily walks in Washington park and stopping at Stacks coffee or Iron coffee co. There’s so much within walking distance that I often didn’t even need to drive. I could even walk to work if I needed to (I worked night shift as well and while its a decently busy street I had no issues and it’s always quiet in the evening/nighttime). Parking was never an issue, always able to find a spot in the street. The apartment is beautifully updated, has everything you need for a short or longer stay. I would absolutely stay again, loved this little slice of Albany!"

We had a lot of fun exploring! <br/>Allen was VERY responsive and was flexible with our check in time when we arrived early. He is great as a host! <br/>Just a few downsides to this particular spot: The apartment is not quite as nice as expected from the photos - it is definitely more of an old city row home feel. Also a bit noisy: mostly road noise, and a few times it felt like the neighbors were in the apartment because sound carries so much. But the bedroom is generally quiet. Lastly, there is no eating table, so for people who value meals together or want a table for games, that is something to consider."

I looked forward to returning to the nicely appointed kitchen to make my own meals or warm up leftovers from nearby restaurants. The bed is comfy and looks over beautiful Washington Park.  The fireplace is fabulous and I always felt safe.  Great value as well."

The location is also great, very walkable to local favorites and easy to get to other locations in the capital region. Would definitely stay again in the future!"

15393,50211226,1691816390,2023-06-25,5065637,Ilga,"Highly recommend, don’t hesitate to book. Wonderful, peaceful, clean, uncluttered place to stay. And welcome snacks! Very clean and well-appointed. Had everything I needed and more, such as in the kitchen. I was able to park right in front of the building both nights! Good location to get around from, depending on where you’re going, of course. Jake & Kate were so responsive and also sent everything I needed in advance to get in, which was also very easy."

The kitchen is well equipped and there is a great dining area, a relaxing lounging space and a comfortable home office. Kira is an attentive host and checked in ahead of some inclement weather to ensure I was okay and not in need of anything. There are all manner of wonderful walks just a short car ride away. Delaware Ave has some gems in walking distance including a super movie theatre and Delaware Supply with excellent and varied craft beer."
1339,8915877,67080430,2016-03-26,1994129,Alex,Molly was a great host. Place was easy to find. She helped us get street parking. Her space was comfy and clean and the apartment was conveniently located - a 15 minute walk to The Hollow.
17276,53567589,1283631616,2022-08-24,82155437,Dominic,"Brian's brownstone basement was anything but ""basementy"": bright, nicely decorated and lit, spacious, and clean--exactly like the photos!  A few blocks from Washington Park (great for walking or running), Lark Street is filled with cafes, restaurants, and bars and only a few minutes from some other good eats: Shining Rainbow (be adventurous and try their beef and bitter melon), Cafe Cappricio (try their grilled octopus, their filetto di pomodoro, and a martini), and Copper Crow (order the pupusas with the aji verde to share and the street corn pasta--then put some of the aji verde on the pasta!).  Oh, enough about restaurants: Brian's place has free streaming (I finally got to see SOUL on Disney+), a Keurig, excellent soaps, and everything you'd need to dine in if you wanted (but don't: got to Cafe Cappricio especially!).  My only complain was, well, the ice tray has the TINIEST ice cubes ever lol.  Enjoy your stay!"

18948,-138713049,-1038059092,2022-07-01,354914261,Nina,"This apartment was so cute and perfect for our trip! Very clean and clearly recently renovated. Also within walking distance of most things you’d want to do in Albany, which was great!<br/>The only thing to be aware of is that there is no AC in the apartment - not great for an end of June trip! There’s no fan in the master bedroom (that I found, anyway) - so it was pretty toasty! There’s also a fire escape that leads right up to the window, so not ideal if you want to leave the window open overnight to cool things down.<br/>Additionally, the neighbors were playing music loudly until around 10pm. Overall, a pretty noisy neighborhood. It didn’t bother us too much, but if you need to be up early/have kids, might be something to take into consideration!"
3728,13083497,-23116113,2022-05-15,18323086,Molly,"Not what we expected. Definitely a disappointing airbnb stay. The house needs some work and had multiple issues. The furniture and decorations look straight out of a yard sale, just old, nothing matches. The towels were old and smelled bad. The beds were fine, but after stripping the sheets as required, very grossed out by the yellow mattress pads. It just felt run down and not completely clean. There were passive aggressive signs everywhere. I've stayed in much better places in Albany. Look elsewhere if you can."

Neighborhood seemed a little sketchy at night. <br/>Lots of cool bars and restaurants within walking distance. <br/>Parking is on street but had zero issues with parking all 3 nights. <br/>Good value.

Even on a night when downtown is full due to an event at the arena or one of the theatres, there’s always a parking spot within a block of the place."
18882,585428096,1128028054,2023-05-21,24089628,Johanna,Lori’s place was just what we needed!  A home away from home.  It was super comfortable and spacious.

1144,6623339,559188032,2019-11-03,18343357,Vikki,"We had a wonderful stay at Terra's place. The idea of staying in a restored police precinct from the 1800s sounds daring and exciting! The apartment is updated, clean and comfortable. Terra was responsive when I called with any questions. It is in a great location, right around the corner from Lark St. It might be a little loud  outside at night on the weekends, but that's because you're in the heart of the Village in the City. I would definitely recommend this place when visiting Albany!"

I  very much enjoyed the space and having a  respite after a busy day.  Michael and Flerida are superhosts in every way and their property will not disappoint.<br/>Close proximity to downtown Albany—a charming, cozy and tranquil dwelling space."

The sheets smelled sour like they hadn’t been washed recently. The beds were uncomfortable. And really there was an overall bachelor funk to the whole place. The pullout bed in the couch was broken but also had no cushion and was filthy. So my niece stayed on the other couch which was really uncomfortable. We got to this place really late the first night so had no choice but to stay there. Soon after we got there, we decided to get a hotel for the other 2 nights. I messaged Earl and he was very quick to apologize for our unhappy stay. He refunded me for the last 2 nights."

You helped me dealing with NYE in Times Square so much better than it could of been.  The place was awesome and relaxing, only issue I had was with the bathtub that it would get cold after a few minutes.  Nothing that can’t be fixed though.  Next time I’m up in Albany I’ll definitely be staying at one of your properties again."

I liked that she had essential oils diffusing when we arrived. Parking can be a little tricky if you are used to living in suburbia.  We easily double parked to unload and then went to park the car. We were leaving prior to 9 am so moving the car for street cleaning wasn't an issue. That's city life for you.

It is nicely decorated and has a ton of space. Both bedrooms are large and the master bedroom has a huge walk in closet you could easily fit an air mattress in. There are 2 huge couches and 2 nice TV’s. There is 1.5 bathrooms and the master bath has a whirl pool tub. The kitchen has a coffee maker and a k cup coffee maker. There was cream and sugar and other amenities such as plates, silverware, cooking utensils, paper towels, garbage bags, aluminum foil/plastic wrap, and bottled water. Literally everything you need. The apartment complex itself is a bit rough and it’s loud at night. It’s a short walk to MVP arena and parking was super convenient. I would absolutely stay again. I 100% reccomend it, even though it’s in a “sketchy” part of town."

10511,35793179,1687079167,2023-10-12,106089937,Hing,"Ed and Anne were gracious hosts in a quiet safe neighborhood. I had nice conversations with both of them separately as Anne was there for the first part of my stay and Ed was there for the second part of my stay. They also lived in the house which made communication much easier.<br/>All the guest bedrooms were on the second floor and I stayed in room 2. I shared the bathroom with another guest in room 4, but that wasn't a problem as it was mostly free when I needed it. Since I've been traveling for awhile, it was nice that they let me use their washer and dryer. The kitchen was useful for heating up my leftovers as well.<br/>I chose this home because it was affordable and right in-between two places that I needed to get to so that made it centrally located for me. There were a number of neighborhood restaurants to choose from about a 5-minute walk away and I ate at two of them."

The house has 2 smaller bedrooms on the 1st level and the larger bedroom on the second floor so everyone was able to have their own space.

The bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on in an airbnb. The bathroom is huge and spotlessly clean. The towels and sheets are good quality. There is a large TV with every imaginable streaming service and live TV. The location is very convenient to the local colleges and hospitals. There are a few good restaurants within walking distance. I ate at Oyster and Ale and can highly recommend it. I didn't use the kitchen, but was able to keep a few things in the fridge."

The apartment is walking distance to Capitol and some restaurants. It is a very old building and has quirks that go along with that but it’s clear he takes pride in cleaning and making it the most comfortable possible. <br/>A few things to note: if you’re not used to living in a city, the main Street is quite loud at night. <br/>The main bedroom bed is one the most comfortable beds I’ve ever had in an Airbnb."

Alice was a very welcoming, thoughtful and generous host who went out of her way to make my stay an enjoyable one. Her apartment is in a quiet neighborhood and is well decorated, a calm and relaxing space, with a comfortable guest room that looks out over the park opposite. The apartment is an excellent location on one of Albany's historic streets, with superb architecture, city sights, and an excellent choice of restaurants and cafes all within easy walking distance. I was a first-time visitor to Albany, and Alice's suggestions on local attractions and dining options helped immensely. After exploring the city, it was always a treat to return to the apartment -- a nice place to come back to. I'm looking forward to returning. Highly recommended."

There are lots of places to eat in the area. I loved the decor of the apartment. <br/>The only area for improvement I would note is that I had to reach out to Terra for check-in information. Also, I asked for restaurant recommendations and she didn’t reply. Other air bnbs I have stayed in provided this information several days in advance, which was nice."

The room has a private fridge, hair dryer and a nice modern bathroom with plenty of light and mirrors. It also has its own AC for you to control. Easy check in and access. I loved it so much I booked it for 2 more trips in July. It almost feels like staying at a hotel, but for a much better rate! I almost want to keep this place a secret so it doesn’t book up, because I will be using it whenever I go to Albany. :)"

It is hard to find places that can accommodate us that are affordable and have a flexible cancellation schedule. Michael & Flerida’s house ticked all the boxes. Location was right where we needed to be for the NCAA basketball tourney. Spacious first floor allowed us to be together comfortably. Bedrooms were nicely appointed (TVs in every bedroom for those late games). Kitchen had everything we needed. And the house itself was charming — arabesque arches, amazing original oak flooring, gorgeous woodwork and a stained glass window in the living room that just glowed in the sun! And clean!!! Michael & Flerida had great recommendations and were proactive in their contact with us. We have rented several houses in the past couple years, and this might be our favorite one. Neighborhood is a compact, urban residential one, but it was quiet, there was plenty of parking and we would stay there again in a heartbeat. Thanks so much for everything!"

It is super clean; the beds are so comfy, this kitchen has a big fridge/freezer, really nice stove, big microwave and nice dishwasher. The washer and dryer are really nice too. We enjoyed many friendly neighbors! . Backyard was a treat for us and our little dog! This neighborhood is any easy walk to SUNY Albany campus where we enjoyed walking our dog around their little lake. It is also a five minute drive to Buckingham Lake (park) with a beautiful playground, fishing and walking path around the lake. A three minute walk from the house takes you to three great pizzeria/sub shops (one with really good baked goods), Ted’s Fish Fry and a Chinese takeout. Across the street is a small plaza with wonderful bagel/coffee/breakfast and lunch restaurant, and another popular sub shop. You will also be within eight minute drive of three big shopping malls and So. Much. More. We will be back!"

Plenty of cooking tools, as well as things like olive oil, salt, coffee, honey, etc. The layout was perfect for us, two couples, who appreciated the privacy of each party having their own level (the loft upstairs is really nice and romantic!).  <br/>The fenced-in back yard was a huge plus, and our golden retriever, Buckets, really appreciated the space to run around and play in the snow!! There was a fire put and BBQ grill that we will definitely put to use next time we visit.<br/>The neighborhood was lovely, with plenty of dining and shopping spots nearby. <br/>The host was perfect and so attentive! The previous guests took her oven mitts, so she was gracious enough to drop some off the next morning so we wouldn't burn our hands!<br/>Fast WiFi and plenty of TV options to pick from!<br/>The space was very clean (obviously recently remodeled) and plenty of hot water to go around for the four of us (and great water pressure too!). <br/>Look forward to staying again!"

Está bastante envejecido.<br/>Lo que menos nos gustó fue el barrio.Aunque estaba muy cerca del centro y de zonas estupendas para visitar, a partir de la tarde la calle se llena de gente de muy mal aspecto, drogadictos, sin techo.... hay broncas entre ellos y da bastante miedo, la verdad."

Batteries in the thermostat were low as well. Other than that it’s an okay place to stay if u need something inexpensive with three beds and 1 bath."
12863,44180048,1428546627,2022-08-02,178253298,Ambi,"The stay was gorgeous and clean, as pictured. The bed was the softest bed I’ve ever encountered. Lloyd provided an instructional guide (for Wi-Fi, TV, local restaurants) that was incredibly helpful.<br/>While I did not meet Lloyd in person, he was excellent about communicating check-in/check-out, and everything else in between. I would absolutely stay at this property again."

We loved how comfortable the bed & couch were, as well as the soft blankets & pillows. Thomas and Justin really did think of everything; there was something new to discover in each cabinet and drawer! We thought the Nerf guns & games were a fun touch, and we were getting a kick out of the sound-controlled light panels.<br/>Our entire stay was peaceful & quiet. Getting to take a bath in the giant tub at night with the provided Epsom salt and getting to shower in the morning with the natural light from the skylight were cathartic experiences I didn’t even know I needed! The pool was lovely for a quick dip in the evening. I wish our stay was longer because there’s so many amenities to enjoy and we didn’t have the time to try them all! <br/>We felt very safe and taken care of and would definitely stay here again. We highly recommend Thomas and Justin’s home!"

There’s one induction stove cook-top in the kitchen if you’re looking to cook but the fridge is not full sized. The place has a rustic feel to it, which I really liked.

Comfy bed & good Wi-Fi.<br/>Pet friendly, I brought my Frenchie & she loved the place.<br/>Parking lot on side of building (make sure to get parking tag out of welcome packet & hang on rear view mirror.<br/>Great location, literally right off highway on east side of Albany. Just what I needed, as I was going to the races in Saratoga a couple of days. Lots of great places to eat & drink nearby. My favorites are Lost & Found and Tanpopo Ramen. Also, Albany Distillery is like 50yds away for amazing drinks.<br/>Linda & her crew answered messages very quickly & had great communication for check-in.<br/>Cons-the area is definitely building up, but it can be quite intimidating & is rough & tumble looking, as it’s adjacent to an industrial area & has a lot of old buildings.<br/>Checking in, you have to go underneath the front steps to the left & duck your head if you’re taller than 5’8”, as the apartment is the converted basement of the walk-up above.<br/>The backyard is a bit scary w/one light and is a steep climb out the back door if you need to walk your dog. I kept her on the leash to be safe since it’s a huge shared yard for the entire building & some of the fence has seen better days."

We had a couple of tiny mishaps during our stay but they were taken care of with ease and that’s what makes her such a great host.

1429,8915877,158819241,2017-06-08,39471203,Stuart,"This street level apartment was in a good central location in downtown Albany, overlooking the governors mansion and the dramatic Empire State plaza. The apartment is fully furnished, comfortable, and had an eclectic feel. The neighborhood had lots of historic charm and felt up and coming, if a bit edgy. It was quiet overnight, but definitely be prepared to hear noise from neighbors and passing vehicles during the evening.   Overall, this place is a fine option for urban explorers and adventurers who thrive in these kind of environments. "

Der Gastgeber hat an wirklich alles gedacht, das ist eine sehr nach dem Gast orientierte Dienstleistung. Die Betten sind sehr komfortabel , es gibt alles in dieser Wohnung und noch ein Stück darüber hinaus. Die Ausstattung ist geschmacklich ästhetisch und gut durchdacht. Wir waren sehr zufrieden und bedanken uns für den Gastgeber für diesen Aufenthalt. Der Standort ist zentral mit dem Blick auf den Park. Fussläufig  erreicht man alle Lokale um gut essen zu können. Für den Frühstück empfehlen wir Iron Gate Cafe, für den ersten Kaffee am Morgen hat der Gastgeber mit der Kaffeemaschine und dem Zubehör vorgesorgt , auch für die Teeliebhaber.

You will find staples in the kitchen like salt, pepper, oil, vinegar, cutting boards, even microwave  popcorn and wonderful appliances.  There is a thermostat for heat and air conditioners were installed in anticipation of the warmer season.  The shower is an endless rain of warmth.  The entire house is spotless.  Motion detection lights keep the backyard and driveway visible and safe.  Though we didn' use them this visit,  there is a very large cook grill, outdoor chairs, table, and fire pit in the enclosed backyard.  A washer and dryer are also installed.  Everything is available for your comfort.  Diana always responds to email, or text within the hour promised.  We recommend Diana's place highly.   Just like home."
9717,32993402,-464323636,2023-10-20,496625510,Edward,Disappointed with apartment which was dusty & dirty with stains. No evidence of regular cleaning. Also run down and in poor state of repair. Plumbing failed during our stay and we were given a code for another building to use the toilet. Code didn’t even work. Area felt unsafe with drug dealers and users. Our two Uber drivers were shocked to see tourists staying in the area as it is well known to be a “bad” area. Couldn’t wait to leave. My first trip to USA & felt really let down. Would NOT recommend.

The apartment was even more beautiful than the listing could show; it was wonderful how you designed this space with such care and respect for the beautiful crown molding and ornamentation! You also had every amenity we could have thought of, thank you!<br/>We truly felt right at home in your apartment, and we would absolutely stay here on a future trip up north.

But it’s center of Albany and great for nightlife and going to all the best restaurants in town. The bed was my only concern. Sheets were clean and everything but the bed itself smelled like a man had been sleeping in it and then he last minute changed the sheets. I would bring your own blankets. Otherwise it was a great stay. Bring an extra bath towel too, they only had one. The pizza downstairs was amazing!!! I would recommend this to the younger crowd, but not to the elderly as the stairs were very steep and dangerous."

Choosing it because of its proximity to University at Albany (9-10 drive), we didn't suffer from expensive taxi trips to and fro when traveling for commencement events. <br/>The space was large enough for us not to be on top of one another. We were welcomed with a book providing information about things within the apartment, the neighborhood (e.g. closest pharmacy), and Albany. Clean throughout the apartment, we had no hesitations when settling in and relaxing.<br/>Different amenities were available for use in case something was forgotten (e.g. body cream, body wash, hangers, iron, etc.). Because of plans with additional family, we didn't utilize the oven/stove but were happy knowing it was there in case it was needed. <br/>Though the neighborhood was slightly noisy due to the guys riding their RVs and motorcycles up and down the block. It wasn't bothersome (NYC resident), and our stay was peaceful most of the time."

Easy access to the interstate, great places to eat near by and walking distance to a few attractions of downtown.  Parking was pretty easy and driving around town was no problem thanks to the location of the loft. <br/>This loft is one of a kind, it is simple and cute! I would definitely stay here again!<br/>However there are a few things you should consider before you stay, such as beds and kitchen appliances. Also keep in mind you will be staying on a Main Street right near the interstate. You won’t hear interstate traffic but if you are all light sleeper you may hear the local street traffic in front of the apartment. I didn’t have a problem with the noise, but my friend that I had with me didn’t sleep so well a couple nights. But I also sleep pretty heavy. <br/>I would stay again. Earl and his team are wonderful. He was quick to respond and provided all the basics! Definitely worth the money!"

Super easy check-in and check-out, clean house, comfy beds, easy parking, and fast wifi. Convenient to restaurants. We ate at Umana Restaurant & Wine Bar one night and Salsa Latina Restaurant the other - both excellent (the latter had an awesome buffet on a Monday night). We didn't do any cooking but the kitchen looked well stocked. Diana had a Keurig machine and provided some coffee pods (which we didn't use as we work in zero waste and fighting plastic waste). Diana was super responsive. We wouldn't hesitate to book again if we're ever back in Albany. Thanks Diana!"

11596,39864828,-1881272972,2022-08-19,53837752,Stephanie,"the place was big and photos are accurate. the extreme-ness of the ""no more than 4 guests or he would call the cops"" rule seemed a little extra but it was not too bad as we were there while our apt was inaccessible due to a fire in the building. When he says it is a respect to the neighbors, we showed up at 11 pm the first night and it seemed to be offices and warehouses around, maybe 4 cars parked out on the entire block. As well, the floor had to be swept when we first arrived, since my toddler was walking barefoot and his feet got dirty within the first hour. There was also intense rain on one of the days and a puddle of water formed in front of both entrances to the place. I texted the house about it and he did respond within an hour which is nice, but he just let me know that it happens during intense rain and he was okay leaving it or if we wanted it cleaned up he would stop by to clean it up the following day. It seemed a little weird for a super host and someone that states the place is good for children to have that response. My toddler was trying to splash in those puddles and I ended up cleaning it myself before the host got back to me. Aside from these things, the place was big, nice looking, accurate to photos, had many amenities, especially in the kitchen. The place is a lot more suitable for adults, and older children."

She was easy to communicate with and contact. Her place is outstanding; it's one of the best Airbnb places I've stayed at, period. It's very warm and welcoming, comfortable and clean. What more can you ask for? The location in Albany is great, as it's in a more quiet area but right across the street from the Governor's Mansion and near large open green spaces. I had a car and it was very easy to access anything else I needed to do (it's less than 20 minutes to other areas, including Whole Foods and Trader Joe's). I highly recommend you snatch up a reservation here, as it seems Molly's place books up quickly!"

I haven't booked short term airbnbs in the area, but for longer term rentals I think this is the best deal in the area. It's roomy, ideal location, great hosting, has all amenities you could need and at the best price in the area. It's basement level, but has a wall of windows in back and is not facing the street so it's quiet. I usually parked around a 5 minute walk away but finding a spot is almost never a problem"

Upon arrival, we could not get in as the lock code was wrong, however upon reaching out to Chadell, her response was quick and we were able to gain access right away. The location is great if whatever you need is downtown. We went into town for a comedy show and we were able to walk to the venue.  Prior visitors commented on the area being or ""feeling unsafe"" - the place is downtown Albany. There is literally nothing wrong with it; no one bothers you and there is no secret as to where the location is. If you don't like city life, book in the suburbs. The pictures of the place were more or less accurate however it could be cleaner. It was tidy but the place needs a good clean. The backyard left much to be desired. If you are more than two people, you should pack towels. Place is fine for a short stay, however has potential for much more."

Our stay was more than a week. This property, on the edge of the heart of downtown, is multicultural and in an area currently being revitalized. It has many positive features including a modern kitchen and refurbished bath and newly installed hardwood floors. The bed was comfortable and the apartment bright. We did, however, find the walk to the downtown area was beyond our limits and we could not locate a nearby grocery store. There are interesting breweries and pubs close by we enjoyed visiting."

Adam picked me up from the bus station and brought me back the next morning. He prepaired a delious dinner, breakfast and lunch package for me. You can't expect more from an airbnb for this price. Adam is a really special person who cares for everything you need. :)"

Clyde was also very helpful if there were ever issues, and I felt like I had a lot of privacy. Just know that if you have any mobility/accessibility issues with stairs, you have to walk up ~50 steps to get to this room! I didn’t mind but it could deter some :) overall a wonderful longterm stay"

Earl was great at communicating and our stay went well. My only complaints would be that the bathroom was outside of the room along with the light switches, and the HVAC was very, very loud at night. However I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a clean space to stay on a budget because the value was unbeatable."

The kitchen was well stocked with appliances, pans, dishes for cooking. We enjoyed sitting on the back deck for our morning coffee and on the front porch for a glass of wine in the evening. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. We really appreciated how clean the home was, and check in/out was easy. This is a great place for families, couples, or a work away from home stay.

It was a bit far from downtown and we had to drive everywhere but the apartment was just like the description. It was close to the highway so we heard and felt the trucks all night, I didn’t mind too much as I’m from a city where those noises are typical, but something good to note as my friend had a harder time getting used to it. <br/>Angela was very responsive and always responded very timely. She checked in on us after our first night to make sure everything was ok. <br/>The apartment itself was bigger than the pictures make it seem. I liked the exposed brick and wood accents around the house. It was a cozy place to stay on a fall weekend away."

Earl was very responsive and a great host - sending me all the information I would need for check-in and check-out well ahead of time, and then helping me troubleshoot the access code when we arrived late and couldn't get in (which might've been my fault). <br/>As other reviews have noted, the apartment is a bit run-down, so not sure I would book it for an extended stay. Also good to note that this is a ground floor unit in a larger building with other rooms/apartments and young people staying there playing music, smoking, etc. Earl is good about enforcing the quiet hours, but just FYI."

Everything inside is new, well thought out, and clutter-free. We loved that it had so much space: two bathrooms (one on each floor), a large living room adjoining the kitchen, two lovely bedrooms upstairs, plus a wide landing/sitting room. It also has a sweet patio right off the kitchen. My children enjoyed the attic-style “kids’ room” with two mattresses, and the master bed was comfy. There were lots of closets too. <br/>Communication was easy and Alexis or Bronson responded immediately. <br/>We will certainly try to stay here again when we’re in the area!"

His flexibility was commendable.<br/>The visual representation of the space accurately represents its actual appearance.<br/>My encounter with the bathroom was of such an exceptional nature that it has elevated my expectations regarding bathroom amenities and spatial accommodations while on the road.<br/>Another positive aspect was the cleanliness of the unit, which ensured my tranquility was not disrupted.

Very quiet home and neighborhood and perfect for sleeping… I’m a night-shifter so that’s often an issue for me. The home was stocked with anything and everything. Also this home is immaculate. Perfect 5 star review!!!

Appreciate finding dog friendly places. My GSP Angel was quite comfortable and the street was pretty quiet. We were a short walk to the Center Square area of Lark street, plenty to do. Would definitely stay here again next time I am in Albany. Jake was very communicative and accommodating."
11507,39864828,924081588,2021-10-03,41930932,Melissa,"Beautiful, spacious loft. This was the perfect venue to use for getting ready for our wedding. The space is large and has very cool/fun vibes. Our favorite part (besides the aesthetic and  cool entry way) was playing corn hole! The location is awesome for going out in that part of downtown (nine pin area)."

21257,-113222432,-1611528870,2023-11-01,25942,Cathy Lyn,"David's place worked out well for us.  We were in town for a couple of concerts.  We could walk to the venue (The Egg), restaurants, Art & History Museum, the Capitol, & corner markets.  Parking was not on premises but rather street parking.  Every day but 1 we were able to find a spot on the block.  The apartment is on the second floor facing the street and had everything we needed for a 5 day stay.  It's spacious and clean.  Thank you, David!"
1029,6623339,239654285,2018-03-02,9440309,Monica,"Terra's place is wonderful - well laid-out, plenty of room, and stylishly decorated.   The cute bedroom had a big closet (not that I needed it for my overnight stay, but . . . ) and the kitchen came equipped with everything a person may need for a short or longer stay.  As others noted, noise was a bit of an issue at night but I was so tired that it didn't keep me up.  Check-in was a breeze and she was a super responsive communicator.  I would definitely recommend staying here!"
6538,25549565,319530813,2018-09-06,88476540,Pearl,"I was pleasantly surprised with my stay at Janet’s place - the space is immaculately clean, comfortable and had great amenities. Pictures don’t do justice to the place. I loved the location too - it is located in a historic house along a shaded tree-lined street, close to restaurants at Lark Street and close to the Capitol area as well. I felt recharged and well-rested after my stay here. Definitely do stay here if you ever find yourself in beautiful Albany."

Elsa and Lloyd were incredibly friendly and responsive and we had all the things we needed to feel at home. They took every COVID precaution necessary. The bed is very comfortable, the bathroom and kitchen are well appointed, and the space is full of windows. One note: The space does not have a microwave—not a problem for us, as we used the stove. Will definitely stay again!"

4794,20519885,-102423314,2021-08-15,411849537,Cindy,"Michael and Flerida are wonderful hosts. Their place is spacious, has a lot of character, and is updated beautifully. It worked so well for our family, instead of staying in a hotel — so much room to just kick back and relax together comfortably, rather than in the open public space at a hotel."
1397,8915877,109869845,2016-10-23,35552165,Melvin,Home was cozy. Parking is on-street with some restrictions depending on day. Would suggest contacting host if parking is a must during your stay.

We came for an event and didn’t have much time to explore the area, but found we were very close, even walkable, to everything we needed.  The apartment check-in was seamless,  and Jake even provided pictures to avoid any confusion.  Street parking (dead-end road) was easy and safe and very conveniently right next to the apartment entrance!  Apartment is very clean and welcoming with a super comfortable bed, clean bathroom, kitchen well stocked with necessities for meals, and a beautiful and cozy living room with Netflix provided for relaxing.

When I got there, it was very difficult of a check in process. When I got there the place was filthy- bed and shower mostly- had to clean everything. I did communicate this with them and they did give me 3 nights for free due to this which was nice. There is NO parking and during the week received multiple tickets so be aware of that. Location is good- felt safe for the most part. Apartment is spacious as well."

The attention to every detail is amazing. The TV in the bedroom almost provides a cinematic experience! Lloyd is very communicative and accommodating. My daughter loved that there is a TV in the bathroom!! We were pleasantly surprised that there was in fact air conditioning! We will definitely be staying here again when we are in the area! Lloyd’s place is a gem and deserves way more than 5 stars!!!

The house was beautiful, clean, and comfortable, as was the bedroom and bed. A perfect place to stay!!!!!!"

10679,35914565,1211754181,2022-03-20,12461639,Jackie,"The apartment is lovely and uniquely decorated. The jacuzzi tub is amazing!! The water was nice and hot too despite it being a large tub. The apartment is on a first floor so there’s street noise (not loud, just there like people entering/exiting the building). There’s about 3 stairs up to the bed but other than that it’s very flat and accessible for those who need it. We didn’t stay long but Diana was great and sent over all the checkin information and jacuzzi information before we even asked. Great stay, cool building, private parking, and just down the block from the police station. <br/>Also, go to Stacks Espresso Bar for coffee, it’s amazing! Soooo yummy"

Each and every space used to it's advantage with just the right amount of ammentities.  Upstairs are the bedrooms with comfy beds and bedding.  Again, lots of natural light and lighting fixtures for when the sun goes down.  One of the most alluring rooms; the bathroom, is complete with a clawfoot porcelain tub that doesn't run out of hot water. If you’re looking for a quiet place on the outskirts of town, but still a convenienant location for exploring New York State's Capital District, you have found the perfect place.  Dan, the host, is very helpful and communicates swiftly."

18216,1280240482,2115080772,2023-05-23,78682438,Alyssa,"Absolutely loved our short stay at Reyana's! The home is much larger than the photos make it seem, but it still feels cozy. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Our only complaint (which isn't Reyana's fault) was the downstairs neighbor's dog that barked at all hours of the day/night, which made it a little hard to wfh and whatnot. Other than that, we had such a pleasant time."

3143,11253948,266746197,2018-05-20,41039235,Cynthia,This is a lovely little house. It is homey and super comfortable. Over the years I have switched rooms or hotels because of dirty areas. Piotr’s house is very clean and tidy. The floors and stairs are beautifully shined. I thought the stairs would be slippery but they are not at all!  <br/>Appliances are new.  Sonos sound system available for large screen TV.  One block away from busy street with drugstore and restaurants. However the house is very quiet <br/>Outside the back door there is a 2 story deck that is great for entertaining. We had a party of 10 and all fit there comfortably.  <br/>Loved this house and would definitely stay here again.

The bed was super comfy. The kitchen had everything we needed. The apartment is close to Madison Ave and to The College of St. Rose. All in all, it was perfect for our one night stay, and I think it would be perfect for a longer stay as well. I would definitely stay at Elsa's place again."

The location is perfect for exploring all of Albany - there was plenty of parking and we were able to walk pretty much everywhere. The apartment was super well stocked with a full kitchen and everything we needed and Jake and Kate provided some awesome recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the area.

After reaching out to him to let him ask about check-in and check-out times, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that both of these were flexible.  When we arrived to the apartment, he checked in to make sure we had found everything okay, and had even provided insight for parking in the busy city of Albany!  The pictures accurately depict the studio flat, and the bed was very comfortable.  For conferences or functions at the New York State Museum, Empire Convention Center, or the State House, this location is AWESOME.  Thanks, Gregg!!"

I messaged 3 times. all of which went unanswered. we stayed here for 20 minutes. as the description says, there's no Air conditioning. the apartment was around 5 to 10 degrees warmer than the outside temperature which was already 89 degrees. there are no screens in the windows so if you're worried about bugs, or the possibilities of sleeping in downtown Albany in a bad neighborhood at night with all your windows wide open, this place isn't for you. we also noticed in our 20 minutes stay that the bedroom door had been ripped off it's hinges, resulting in absolutely no privacy, and is also a violation of airbnbs rules. determined to stick it out, we then went to the back patio, the main reason for us booking this space, to find that the door was completely inoperable. I sent a minute long video of myself trying the lock in all different positions, pushing as hard as I could, giving the door as much pressure as I could with my entire body. climbing out the window would have been the only option to access it. despite all of these problems, I am still wrestling with Airbnb to try to get a refund. we left about 20 minutes after arriving."

We really enjoyed our stay here, as everything was as advertised. Nicolas's wife, Liz, made some small talk to us and helped us feel at home, and even introduced us to their dog Bella, who we thought was just so awesome! A very happy pup! Overall, we would stay here again as the location was really convenient, and the airBnB itself was really clean.

In addition to your own personal parking in the back of the house, you will typically have street parking in the front of the house in case.<br/>The house itself is perfect for 1-2 people. The house was extremely clean, washer/dryer worked great, and there is plenty of natural light in the apartment. The bed and couch was very comfortable and the kitchen was well equipped with pots, pans, utensils, etc. There are no drawers in the bedroom, however, for clothes and only ~10 hangers, so if you are staying for an extended period of time, you may need to live out of the suitcase. <br/>Highly recommend this space!"

He answered within 5-10 minutes which was nice that he was right on top of everything. He even let us check in a little earlier and was going to let us stay a hour later if we needed to. But we did not need to take advantage of his kindness. Why inconvenience him when we didn't have to after him being so nice to us. I would definitely recommend his place and would definitely think of staying there again if I need to.

I enjoyed Diana herself; we were in sync, watched TV together, I bought an etching of hers that I loved, I loved the artistic way her house was decorated.  I appreciated that things worked - the shower, the sinks, the microwave, the locks, the shed for my bicycle.  That sums it up, Diana the person, and the house itself, were just wonderful and comfortable.  I stayed a whole week, so that all was important."

And the place itself is great in every way... from the location, the supplies (cooking essentials, towels, body wash, extra sheets) all down to the decor which is even cuter than we expected!! Overall it was an awesome stay. Downtown, bars, and restaurants are only about 10-15 mins away and everything you could need is just around the corner(drugstore, grocery store, gas stations, liquor, etc) I would 1000% stay again and recommend this place to anyone looking for a cozy spot in a quiet cute neighborhood!

She has transformed the lovely historic apartment into a well appointed and lovely space with everything you need and nothing you don’t.  Location is super convenient to both walking conveniences as well as easy access to drives to other Albany areas.  Super clean.  Comfy bed.  Street parking right out front.  Loved it and loved her!

Having been from Albany, I was familiar with the area already. It’s close to everything and Julia’s home was well kept and fully stocked. She communicated quickly and was always friendly. Seems like there’s a few ABB’s in the area now and that more improvements are on the way. Highly recommend."

18992,-138713049,-115916777,2023-02-26,175076428,Cassie,"When we arrived, we had a difficult time finding a parking spot that wasn’t going to be a hike to unload our luggage. The listing states “free parking on premises”.  Once we were carrying our luggage in, we had a hard time with the stairs to the building as the steps were all covered with ice with no sign of anyone trying to salt them or scrape the ice. <br/>Once we made it to the apartment, it was much smaller than the pictures made it seem. There were less decorations with made the space less inviting. The walls were gross (need to be washed), the chairs at the dining table felt like they were going to collapse. We also noticed a thong under the couch which tells us whoever is cleaning isn’t doing a great job. Upon checking out the bedrooms, the nightstands were junky and half broken, the main bedroom with the bathroom had shattered glass all over under the window as if there had need a break in. So much else wrong but I can’t fit it in this review. The entire place NEEDS an update."

We were able to walk to a wonderful wine store, delicious Thai food for dinner and a wonderful breakfast place (Iron Gate Cafe).

Everything you need is in this room and there's ample  space to feel comfortable and at ease. She has Charming Victorian touches throughout the space. This rental is an absolute value.

Hosts have maintained the place extremely well. The hosts went the extra mile to make it comfortable for guests and I felt right at home. <br/>The neighborhood is super cute to walk around. Grocery store is around the corner. Coffee shops, bakeries and boutique stores are nearby as well. Plenty of dine-out options was available in the neighborhood. The Empire State Plaza and the New York State Museum are only several blocks away. I had an amazing time. Would recommend 100%. <br/>Street parking was available most of the time but became very restricted from Thursday evening through Friday evening.

I could go on and on, but the three things that truly stand out are the massive showerhead with excellent water pressure, the snacks, quick meals, and drinks provided, and the amazingly comfortable king-size bed and linens.  The hosts are very accommodating and kind.  The little table and chairs set up in the private back patio space is a great place to sit and work or eat a meal."

It was quiet and comfy, with its own bathroom, a mini fridge, a desk, full-size dresser, fluffy towels, everything you need. Plenty of street parking plus more parking behind the house. Walking distance from Albany Med. On the #100 and #13 bus lines. You can get to where you're going. I'd stay there again."

I remember reading reviews about the extraordinary sensory experience that folks had had in this spot, and I thought people were going overboard. But then I experienced it. And I realized that they hadn't been exaggerating. <br/>This place is simply a delight for one's senses! I highly recommend Tom's place to anyone who loves water (a pool, a hot tub, and a deep soak tub = heaven!), and;/or those who adores soft and squishy things. It is comfort exemplified, with lots of comic elements to put a smile on your face, as well. Won't be forgetting this stay any time soon!"

At least until the owner drastically lowers price for the unit or renovated a vast portion of it. <br/>I paid about $2050 monthly for the unit, and it's the worst quality I have seen for this amount of money. I lived in units that cost $1900 and $1700 and they vastly outshine this piece of garbage. <br/>Let me tell you that those other units were not in the basement of a building, and had working TVs that were not partially functioning. I had to invest in a digital antenna that cost $12 at Walmart to watch any local channels, and I'm sure the owner had 12 bucks to spare. Living in the basement was its own bundle of joy, as I heard every goddamn footstep, door opening and effing sneeze the guy on top would do every so often. This was never a thing in my cheaper units from the past.<br/>The window covers were old and breaking down and I had to patch areas with pieces of paper so I wouldn't be seen sleeping."

Overall, it is a good value. <br/>The location is within walking distance to the Egg and MVP, but the neighborhood felt a bit rough and did not feel the safest. We did not really feel safe walking around in the area, especially at night.. <br/>The designated parking area didn't feel secure - there were several people that camped out near an abandoned car in the parking area. I know for many people this would not be an issue, but I wish I had known about the location prior to booking."

Plenty of good restaurants and bars nearby.  Parking on street or in the paid lot 1 block away was hassle free.  Todd communicated with us before and during our stay proactively.  Would definitely recommend to stay here.  Look forward to returning during warmer months.

Jake was an amazing host and left us a note and some snacks on the table for when we got there. The house was so clean, I especially loved the soap/shampoo/conditioner dispenser in the bathroom and how great all the soap and the towels smelled lol. My girlfriend and I stayed here for a romantic getaway to Albany and it was the perfect choice...the memory foam bed is amazing you’ll sleep like a baby, and the couch is perfect for cuddling up on for a movie...the apartment has a real homey feel. We had an absolutely lovely stay and would definitely recommend this place. "
15389,50211226,1303837533,2023-06-05,118260152,Jacqueline,"Jake & Kate are fantastic hosts!  I have stayed at several Airbnbs, and they were the most thoughtful by far. We loved the little added touches-like the welcome snacks and the extra items in the kitchen and bathroom to use if we needed to!<br/>We also appreciated the Keurig cups and the fun selection of flavors. It was a special added delight to our mornings!  <br/>We also appreciated how quick they were to respond. They were flexible with us arriving earlier than we anticipated. The place was sparkly-clean!<br/>We would definitely stay at their home again if visiting the Albany area, as it was very inviting, cozy, and so close to Washington park. Thanks for a great stay!"

3538,12284708,227040303,2018-01-13,77989141,Corrie,The place was ok.  The best part about this place was the bbq joint across the street.  There's no off street parking so several times I ended up parking a block away.  And no shovels to shovel the sidewalk or front steps.... or your car out.  That was kind of annoying because no one else shoveled the stairs or sidewalk either.  So we all just walked through the snow.  Only one bathroom and at one point 5 of us were staying there.... so twice I ran to a store to go to the bathroom.  The mini fridge was a nice bonus.  I ended up getting a space heater for my room when the temps dropped in the teens only because the wind whipped through those old windows.  The kitchen was nice and the laundry area was handy.  I was there for 2 months.  I think this would be a better place for a shorter time
18265,1585263244,-339681302,2022-10-21,373081828,Rualdy,Great host and location. Everything is as described. Would definitely stay there again.

Unit accurately described <br/>Cons: Parking is terrible. You have to get a permit for your car and even with the permit I got several tickets. You can hear every step above your head, even in the living room and there was a dog barking. There’s no TV in bedroom or lamp so it’s just darkness at night but fine if you’re okay with that. I killed a new bug everyday but more so because the area is woodsy.<br/>Linda was nice but not sure I’d stay here again."

He was readily available with any questions that I had and offered great assistance during my time in Albany.  Peaceful neighborhood, close to colleges and lots of restaurants a short walk away.

14433,47828453,752406573,2021-04-26,180701298,Tirzah,Overall this place was nice and well kept. The parking could have been a little more specific especially if you’re not from the Albany area. The instructions to get into the Airbnb were clear and precise. The bedrooms face the Main Street which made it a little noisy at night. I felt it was a little pricey for the area but overall we enjoyed our time here. When we had questions the host answered within an hour or sooner. The host was very welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed for the weekend!

The space is cute and cozy but it kind of smelled a bit funky in there. The apartment was really quiet and being on the bottom of the third floor we never heard any noise. The apartment is located in a charming part of town.

16006,51960331,-294669018,2022-06-02,49256018,Cristina,We are now repeat visitors to this charming apartment.  Marlene gives a very accurate description of the accomodations and location.  And it is easy access to the city as well as the Thruway which served us well in our travels.  We would definitely recommend this to any couple.  The only tip we would give is that you must be able to climb stairs.
4731,20519807,305008660,2018-08-10,154377057,Michelle,"Michael’s place is as advertised, it’s in a great location and you get every bit of what you pay for....totally worth every penny. I had a last minute change of plans and booked very late and arrived late as well but Michael and his wife Freida were quick to respond and in 1,2,3 I was settled in.  I have frequented Michaels home before and am always a satisfied guest....they are simply awesome!  On Thursday night while doing some laundry, I looked out the back door and saw a grey and white cat, so being a cat lover I called the cat and it came up to me to be petted which I loved and for about 10 minutes I sat in between the two doors and had interaction with an uninvited guest (the cat) which was a nice ending to my week. So with all of that being said I would definitely recommend Michaels home to anyone in Albany that needs a comfy spot to stay and I would certainly come back and stay with them again."

Iris was incredibly responsive and friendly. The house was perfect for our family… cozy and homey, but still felt nice, cared for, and cared about. We needed nothing while we were there. Iris had coffee set up for our first morning, which was SO appreciated with our 12:15am arrival. She checked in the next day to make sure everything was ok, was able to give us family friendly recommendations for restaurants. We did laundry, ate breakfast and lunch there, all had comfortable beds, and the 2 window ACs did the job. It was a truly wonderful experience, and we will be back!"

The bed is super comfortable, and I found the kitchen to be well-stocked with utensils and pans/pots for cooking. Parking in the back of the house meant I didn't have to worry about street parking rules. It's close to a park, bars, and restaurants. Quiet, clean, and reasonably-priced. Perfect for one or two people."

I needed a place that would allow our dog to stay over, and I've always loved big beautiful Victorian homes… So John's listing caught my eye. He preapproved our stay with our dog which was great!  The rooms that he rents are on the third floor, they're very well appointed.  The shared bathroom is very nicely done. Guests are able to use the amenities on the main floor of the home too.  All in all, it was a good experience. John has great security in the house, and there is parking in the back of the house.  It's a very convenient spot.<br/>I recommend this property!<br/>Marybeth <br/>"

I tried to plan out this trip with staying at another air BnB for 2 days, then this air BnB for the next two days. I checked out of my first place at 11 AM and walked to the block past this place. There was supposed to be a coffee shop I was planning on reading at for 4 hours (Google and Yelp recommended). The coffee shop is permanently closed and was being used by squatters. Had to take an Uber up about a mile to a different coffee shop. Then finally was able to check in (2pm) to my new air BnB. Get there and there are dirty towels in the room, the bed is not made, the trash is full and there is trash around the room. This is pretty stressful, because I specifically planned out my day to study at the coffee shop, then at the desk in the room, at the air BnB. Left to clear my head and calm my nerves. Called Greg. He was very responsive and told me he would be down to turn over the room in a bit. When I returned the bed was made and the room was clean. The place was pretty clean and there was a laundry machine which was nice. The bathroom was very clean. It is not attached to the room. The kitchenette came in handy as well. It was stressful to plan out a trip based on the schedule, then come to find out my schedule was completely messed up. The house is nice and historic, I was just planning the trip around my Bar Exam which was a very stressful time and this process was an unforeseen additional stress. The room itself was fine. Besides the check in, it was good and Greg was a good host."

The best part is that when I arrived I forgot to go shopping but Allen had all the necessities needed to a weeks stay. The area is beautiful and not far from places to get food or have a fun night out. The couch and bed are BEYOND comfortable and  will definitely be booking again 100%

She is very accommodating for her guests, and is always looking out for their health and safety. We needed a few things adjusted during our stay and she did everything she could to go out of her way to help us. Sonya is above and beyond and I completely recommend a stay in one of her units. The unit itself is clean and cozy. It is in a fun location with  a very comfortable bed and a nice mini fridge to hold anything you may need to keep cool."

Inexpensive, comfortable, and apportioned with all the basics. If I'm back in the area, I would definitely stay again. The neighborhood is a typical working class neighborhood - but close (driving) to the main events in Albany.<br/>The hosts were some of the most communicative that I've experienced - there was a minor issue that was fixed easily, quickly, and with only minor inconvenience. Better than I could have asked for."

The walls are thin and it was pretty loud during the day but by the time we went to bed it was much quieter. It was a little difficult to find parking. The pizza place downstairs was so good! This apartment was great for the price and just what we needed for a night’s stay.

The alarm that sounded like a police siren kept going off every time you walked out the door and there was a large camera. Overall it got the job done in terms of providing beds but was not somewhere where I would want to hang out.  Osas was responsive which was a positive but overall not worth the cost."
17437,53645427,49583610,2023-02-26,64242142,Hilary,"The place is walkable to most things. It’s a little off the beaten path, which made my mother in law nervous, but we were fine. The apartments are a bit noisy, even after hours, but we had noise machines for the kids. There is only one control for the entire apartment which caused the main room to be hot and the bedrooms to be quite cold. It just happened that we were visiting on a cold Feb weekend. It would be really nice in summer I would think! Lisa was accommodating. We had 2 cars. She left us 2 parking passes. Everything was very easy. We had fun and it was exactly what we needed."

We contacted him three times after checking in for minor problem solving, and he was congenial: and helpful. Here are two tips -- 1. Pay attention<br/>closely to parking guidelines 2. Read the laminated information pages placed around the apartment, 3. If you have mobility challenges as I do, be prepared to adapt to an old building that requires adaptation.

There's a little playground in the lot behind the back entrance. The apt was quiet and the open area behind the building is peaceful. There are two tiny ethnic mini marts a few blocks away.

There is a large section missing from one of her concrete steps going to up to the exterior house, so keep an eye out for that. Some areas of the bedroom were not cleaned, but overall it was a nice space. I would recommend Emilie's house if you need a spacious and relaxing place to stay in the Albany area."

Exactly as described, the well-furnished attractive interior was comfortable for my husband and I in one room and my daughter, her partner and infant in the other.  The baby could sleep at in the bedroom which is located at the far end of the loft while we were able to hang out together at the opposite end, watch TV and talk.  During our second night the younger generation were able to easily walk to some local night spots while grandma and grandpa stayed in to babysit. Generally, its a quiet spot with just an occasional sound of a train or truck, but hey, that's part of the charm.  With family in the Albany area I can see the possibility of a return, although I'm certainly interested in the other properties Matthew has to offer."

Bathrooms & kitchen seemed recently renovated & in an immaculate state. Every room was furnished with all necessary materials & more even than we expected. <br/>A real highlight of the house is the aesthetic & atmosphere: Tom has an amazing collection of eclectic art works & furniture which give the place great character without undermining the historic feel. Music was played on the lower floor through the day: upbeat modern in the morning, & soft classical in the evening, giving the place an amazing vibe (note the music is unintrusive & can't heard from the private rooms). <br/>Tom was incredibly welcoming, friendly & accommodating & made us feel like we were staying with a good friend. He was communicative & flexible in advance of our stay, & happy & available to assist us in any way while we were there. <br/>We can't recommend this stay enough."

They definitely have a brand that literally came through in the clutch for me. Everywhere you turn, the home layout meets your needs. The cabinets are labeled and when you  open them, you can tell Abba gave thought.  The way the sheets were folded, brand name high quality products,  bottles of water in the fridge, clean appliances,  it's really fancy here! Money well spent. Anytime my sister who is a traveling nurse comes to Albany, all my guests will be recommended for the Abba guesthouse.  It's an apartment in a house but it really feels like home. I  made notes about things I want to try from them in my own place. There's foil,  dishes, cooking utensils, decorated really classy.  They take care of their property.  I moved back to Albany from Florida and it met all my needs,  things no other place has provided. I'm a loyal customer now. See you guys next holiday"

Liz is a very accommodating host - who  was lovely to talk to and very thoughtful.  The heat was not working properly so she made sure I had an electric blanket and turned on a space heater so that when I got home the place was very warm and comfortable.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone who needs a convenient and charming location to stay in while in Albany.  .
4691,20518708,487087773,2019-07-13,265280517,Jeff,"It is clear that Michael and Flerida understand the meaning of the word ""home."" Their place was polished and clean and had everything needed for a comfortable stay. They have very strong communication and are transparent about their rules and expectations. This ensures that the place is kept up to par even in their absence (though they are occasionally on-site to check up on things). Their effort and dedication into maintaining this location cannot be overstated enough, and I highly recommend booking a stay here if you are looking for a cozy and affordable home away from home around Albany."

She's quick to respond to all messages. The place is sparkling clean and Alice is full of local tips and restaurant recommendations. I was worried about breakfast, but I needn't have since Alice went out of her way to arrange stuff for me. The location vant be beat. Its a 15 to 20 minute walk to Empire state plaza and is right opposite Washington Park. Its quiet, clean and was the perfect place for me to stay and take the bar.<br/>Thank you Alice and I hope to stay with you again soon!"

Walking distance to the hospital, plenty of restaurants, and a grocery store, this was a great location for us. Terra’s apartment was cozy and comfortable, with all the amenities we needed for the duration of our stay (keurig, pots, pans—Even a cheese grater). Having a designated, off-street parking spot, in-unit washer and dryer, and the ability to receive packages (Hello Fresh was convenient) were all huge bonuses. We were asked for money once or twice from homeless in the area, but walking around at night felt completely safe. We enjoyed our time in Albany and are glad we chose such an accommodating and comfortable place to stay!"

The place had natural light flowing in from the skyline and windows, which evoked a homey and cozy feeling. Earl provided a plethora of spices, pots, pans, coffee maker, etc. He even provided creamer and the coffee! It felt too good to be true at this price point. We will definitely book this place again if we’re in the area."

I went walking there after dark and had no concerns for my safety. The studio in Liz’s home is large and comfortable. The bed is amazing! There’s plenty of refrigerator space and even a bona fide freezer, great for freezing ice packs for the next day‘s journey. The window air conditioner and room fan kept the inside temperature very comfortable on a muggy summer night. I stayed only one night at the studio while passing through Albany, and would do so again if my future travel brings me this way."

The air conditioners were a bit loud but saved us from the blistering heat. After a day of exploring the city I was able to cool off while watching netflix through her television (the Roku was a nice surprise).

My partner and I have been long distance for over two years now and have only been able to meet up a few times in each other's towns. We finally made the great decision of meeting halfway in Albany. Earl's space was perfect for getting a late lunch nearby and also close enough to a local grocery and we were able to make French toast for breakfast at the apartment. Everything was really comfortable and my partner loved the stand-in shower. We were able to watch the season finale of our current show, too! Felt very homey.

We were to stay at another property of his but he was very proactive in letting us know the HVAC needed to be prepared and he wasn't sure if it would be ready in time for check in. He offered us another property and it was just as beautiful and clean looking as the first one we were to stay at. The rooms were nice and spacious , the beds were comfortable, the living room was cozy and cute and the kitchen and bathrooms were in pristine condition. If we had any questions, Phil was very prompt in his response. ( literally within a 5 minute response time) When I come back to Albany, I know where we will stay.

It’s the hostel that I don’t think I knew existed in Albany having not only grown up in the city, but also as an experienced international traveler who regularly chooses to stay in hostels while traveling on a budget. I’m a self-sufficient traveler and Airbnb super host myself. Adam communicates very respectfully and clearly. Breakfast was delicious. Glad he was able do a load of laundry. If I’m in town again I’ll check to see what’s available again."

Despite that, check in was extremely easy. I found all these hand written notes as guidance as well in the room. Bed was super comfy, and the zen garden was a beautiful surprise after a long stressful night. Will definitely be back!"

We never had to worry about finding a parking space and Allen gave simple, to the point instructions on entering his space. It was very nice to be able to do some laundry as well. It definitely served its purpose for us."

20742,1299764,-1784671765,2023-05-07,78797951,Inas,Stayed at Diana's place for a weekend. The place is exactly as described. Having a designated parking spot was a benefit even though there was ample parking. Easy access to downtown Albany by foot or by car. The building was quiet and peaceful at night. Can tell that the unit is well taken care of.
13406,45074220,-668779984,2022-01-08,3521126,Andras,"Angela's apartment is private, quiet and very well layed out. It has a good-size kitchen area with all the essentials. Located close to bus and train and there is free parking at the back of the building. Angela was very attentive to our needs and quick to respond. I would be glad to stay here again."
8797,28868857,-1845527573,2022-06-24,5435124,Liv,"First of all, Earl did refund my money, which I am grateful for. However, the communication with him was quite unfriendly, and the whole experience very stressful for a mom traveling solo with her 6-year-old daughter.<br/>When we checked in, there was a dank, mildew-y  smell. We opened windows, but they were grimy, and an AC unit was falling out of the window. There were two used rags lying about, and the couch and bed linens were stained. There was no way to access the outdoor area which is advertised in the photos for this listing. <br/>The neighborhood is not particularly good, either. Our Lyft driver told us we shouldn't stay there, and this was seconded by our server at a restaurant downtown. We walked through drug activity on our way back to the Airbnb, which is when I decided to try to look for other accommodations. At 9pm, we moved to the nearby Holiday Inn, which was almost the exact same price for the night--and sparkling clean, friendly, with a generous free breakfast and a pool!<br/>I don't like to leave negative reviews, but I feel obliged to let others know so they don't find themselves having to move late at night. Earl was quite rude when I requested a refund the next morning, and said I should not leave a review because I ""didn't stay there"". I furnished pictures to prove our experience. <br/>Again, I'm grateful for the refund, and think this place would be fine for certain folks. But I cannot recommend it."
13787,45529447,-1467086999,2022-10-09,391203845,Alana,Easy check in and a nice quiet space! Lots of local recommendations from the host made our trip even better!!
3008,10768745,-527798812,2023-02-02,510516,Terry,I had a comfortable overnight stay and sleep at Elizabeth’s place. It’s a lovely space in a convenient central location with some nice welcoming touches (such as a little coffee and tea bar). I enthusiastically recommend Elizabeth’s place to fellow travellers to Albany.

19076,-798561921,2020046942,2023-09-19,291261055,Elise,This place was close to where my daughter lives and I had an enjoyable stay at josh’s place. The place was clean and I was happy. they had coffee and sugar and creamer for me to make coffee in the morning although there’s a great place just right around the corner.   Plenty of towels in the bed was comfortable.    The tub is a little high to climb into but that’s because it is an old clawfoot tub.    And there’s a tiny deck in the back which I also enjoyed.

It was clear they pay attention to details when setting up the space, which makes it it feel so luxurious, clean, and homey. It’s in a great area, the hosts are very communicative, and I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone considering a nice place in Albany."

20765,1299764,1144789171,2023-10-09,33743118,Heidrun & Mark,"I'd like to stress that none of the things that make this a less-than-5-star review are in Diana's control. The apartment was clean, had everything we needed, and the beds were comfortable. Unfortunately it's not in a very nice part of Albany. I would have hesitated to walk around the area by myself after dark. The building is older and a bit musty. It's probably not a coincidence that there are plug-in air fresheners in various locations...  Again, the apartment itself was quite nice, and the location is convenient to the Capital Plaza and much of downtown Albany."
7051,25549565,1128293265,2022-07-21,7811621,William,Pretty nice place to stay in Albany :)
11965,40828178,741093256,2021-03-21,136362925,Savannah,"Lloyd’s place was just as sparkling clean and stylish as we knew it would be from prior stays. We found all the signage to be very helpful, and are always so comfortable knowing that all bedding is washed between guests. His attention to detail such as shampoo/conditioner/soap dispensers in the shower and ice in the freezer is never lost on us! It was easy to find everything we needed to cook/bake in the kitchen and the living room space of this particular location was a bit bigger than we’ve been used to. The quiet neighborhood made it easy to rest and we had a wonderful time enjoying local shops in Clifton Park and Saratoga Springs. Lloyd’s places remain our favorite whenever we are in the area! ❤️"
5022,20633175,1121535049,2022-09-25,205769129,Justin,"This is a well-maintained and clean unit, and the owner has put a lot of thought into furnishing and stocking a nice kitchen. Perfect location for walking to downtown Albany (e.g. State Museum - probably not MVP Arena) and also up to Washington Park area. Quite near Lark Street but quiet area. No parking issues, and owner put me on guest pass. Although a garden apartment, it felt secure with a two door entry system. The owner was very good at communication.<br/>Notes: Those with mobility concerns may want to avoid, since there is a small step down from the bedroom to the kitchenette. There is a dehumidifier in the unit that needs to run at all times - it didn't bother me, and actually offers a little white noise, but if it bothers you, you can slide bedroom door shut. Finally, I set the smoke alarm off taking a shower- owner advises closing door to bathroom to avoid this."
17946,288782731,816525269,2022-07-07,444785613,Helaine,"The place isn't in the best neighborhood. We had trouble with the front door lock, the tub, and the coffee maker. There isn't enough hot water for the tub.<br/>Diana was very quick to help us with the door and the coffee maker."

13641,45529316,2027408783,2021-07-18,2217621,L'Tanya,"Linda place is all you need when visiting Albany for the weekend.  Her place is located right off the highway and walking distance to downtown attraction, the plaza center and museum.  There is always something to do and especially great places to eat out and order in.  When visiting Albany, please check out these restaurants. Take an evening stroll to  Dove + Deer or their twin sister restaurant, Rosanna's.  They are across the street from each other on the same block.   On a rainy night, order in from  Rainbow Modern Chinese, you will not regret it, the reviews don't lie.  Oh, I almost forgot to mention, if you're a  Coffeeholic like me,  Linda has many varieties to choose from and vanilla creamers to go with it.  My prediction I will be visiting Albany again and when, Linda's place will be choice."

High ceilings made the property feel even more spacious and lots of sunlight comes through the two big living room windows. This spot is ideal for a solo traveler or a couple. Julia was very quick to respond to any of my questions. Also, my dog is like my child so I have such an appreciation for owners who allow our furry friends to come along. I found the bed to be comfortable and the location was super central as in one direction Lark St. is close by for restaurants, bars and shops while the other direction is a short walk to the downtown area.  The noise from the neighbors upstairs can occasionally be loud but never at night while sleeping. However this is out of Julia’s control and I also live in a downtown city condo so this is second nature for me. I also do agree that the toilet location is tight and could be a bit challenging for a larger person but for most it shouldn’t be an issue. I would definitely stay again!"

My only complaints are that the checkin instructions were incorrect which resulted in us being stuck outside for an hour and missing a restaurant reservation. When we tried calling, his phone was off so we had to contact Airbnb support, who then got a hold of the host and he showed us the correct instructions."

They live right upstairs but allowed me my privacy. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was great. I was able to store my bicycle in the locked foyer. There was everything  I needed within short walking distance. Washington park is a block away and beautiful to walk through. I had no parking issues during the entire stay. There is a EV Chargepoint (free!) around the corner in a parking lot. I could go on and on, but I'll just say that if I decide to turn to Albany in the fall, I will definitely book this apartment."

We did not find it comfortable.  I know I sound like a spoiled brat,  but my kids and my wife did not like the place either.  Photos were real, but the place was very uncomfortable, dark and just plain old...<br/>Also, i don't understand why check in is at 6pm.  We were able to leave our bags though.  I think Earl tries to make the apartment look nice, but he may need to invest some money in it."

Jake also has put together a very thorough and well researched guide to the room and the Albany area.<br/>We really appreciated the well-stocked kitchen--there is plenty of cookware, utensils, and an excellent variety of spices.

However, this Airbnb was booked for five guests but it was only set up for a maximum of four.

There's several parks in walking distance as well, including one across the street. It was a great spot in the heart of Albany. Greg was great at responding regarding my parking request, too. I recommend making arrangements for parking in advance, since it's a crowded historical neighborhood. And for me the old house and it's character are charming. I completely appreciated there was coffee and a few kitchen essentials to help me after a late night arrival after airline delays. Self check in is my favorite, and it was easy, even in the dark."

Check in was easy and quick -- the space is the basement of their home (enter the main house and through the kitchen and into the basement). The space is totally private, with a couch and TV. The room was spacious and the bed was comfy and warm. Really great value!!"

Albany had received a ton of snow a few days prior to our stay, which made the roads and parking in Albany very tight and hectic. But the minute we arrived in Albany, we called Diana's property manager and he directed us to our parking spot, which he had already cleared out in anticipation for our arrival. This place is in a perfect location, just a short drive from food and shopping. We loved it! Thanks Diana!"

They had tea, coffee, and snacks available as well as a personal message written on a chalkboard. It’s a very nice old house but the floors do creak so if you’re a light sleeper it may not be for you. <br/>Overall, we’re very happy with the accommodations and it was just what we needed."

12776,44180048,-1633954751,2021-09-25,481287,Kathleen,"Lloyds place is located in an old federal townhouse that has been restored.  A perfect studio with a huge fireplace/mantle that gives the room charm and focus. Close to downtown and on the edge of a park, we enjoyed the farmers market on Saturday and easy access to downtown where we took in the sights of New York's capital city.  There are restaurants, wine bars and breweries to sample along Lark St, just a few blocks away.  The bed was comfortable, Lloyd has a portable A/C unit which gave us good circulation along with a ceiling fan so the room was never stuffy. The kitchen is equipped with everything you can imagine. The hardwood floors gave the place a modern, clean feel. Lloyd was very responsive and we would highly recommend his place for one or two people."

Thomas is generous and playful in his decoration. There are surprises everywhere you look, from illuminated art that responds to sound to balsa wood animal heads mounted on the wall. A couple of drawers are stocked with cards and games. Beyond the comfy Purple-mattress bed, there are lots of places to sit or sprawl. The bathroom has both a luxurious tub with towel warmer AND a roomy shower stall. Worth noting: only the toilet room is enclosed. The shower and tub area is open to the rest of the apartment. Our quick visit didn't give us time to check out the pool. Next time!"

Albany is our meeting point since we both live east and west of the state.<br/>The directions and rules seem more complicated than they actually are- I think Earl has thought of everything when it comes to offering a space to stay. The location is actually perfect too bc you’re right next to the highway without any noise. The neighborhood was peaceful and we slept really well.<br/>It’s a great walk in the neighborhood and overall pretty safe. <br/>Just beware you’ll need to lug your bags upstairs!!! :) <br/>Earl also has a shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispenser in the shower, and items people need (and often forget) while traveling. Next time I’m in Albany I’ll definitely try to stay here again. Thank you!!!!"

9863,33558235,652803924,2020-08-17,106078213,James,"My son and I needed a place to quarantine for 14 days prior to a move in for his freshman year at a NY college. Not because we had been exposed to Covid or anything, but due to the state we live in being on NY’s “naughty list”. We found this place and loved the amenities listed, the space, and the full kitchen.<br/>Everything was exactly as described. The building is old, so aside from a full gut and remodel, it’s going to have the quirks and character of an old building. Know that going in. If you want pristine finishes etc, this isn’t for you. I was actually reminded of an apartment I lived in for a couple years during college that was one unit of many in a older building.<br/>We appreciated having a stove, refrigerator, and freezer since we had packed two weeks worth of food with us in order to comply with quarantine restrictions.<br/>The wifi was a little spotty a couple times during the course of two weeks. The only reason I mention it is because I assume anyone reading reviews will want to know about the wifi.<br/>AC was appreciated and worked well. Three separate window units. If you are used to central air conditioner, they are certainly louder than you are used to, but sure beats not having any ac.<br/>The apartment was actually larger than we expected, with a long hallway connecting the living space to the bedrooms and bathroom."

The ps4 controller was dead and no charger to be found. Claims “Full Amenities” but the fridge is empty except 1 beer and a empty wine bottle that was tipped over. Only things in the cabinet was months old cereal , coffee with no coffee filters, and popcorn... other than that the location is nice and it was a good stay"

The host was dog friendly, and our pupper stayed alone while we took a trip to Cooperstown for the morning. Floors are a bit thin, so you can hear a lot of creaking and noises above, but it’s nothing that you wouldn’t expect in a basement. Would definitely stay here again."

Allen met us at the door and carried in our bags and showed us around. A tv in both bedrooms and living area with netflix. Very clean and furnished nicely. Very private not sharing the apartment with anyone else. I highly recommend Allens apartment.  We fully enjoyed our time in Albany thanks to this airbnb.

The capitol plaza is just a 10 minute walk and there are lots of little restaurants and a grocery a couple of blocks away. The space was a bit humid during July when I was there even with the dehumidifier working 24/7, but I'm sure the former basement wasn't optimized for ventilation when it was built in the 19th century.  The neighborhood is a bit sketchy to look at, but I never felt in danger and I walked everywhere day and night noodling around with Pokemon Go while I was there.  This is a fine choice."

Didn’t receive check in info until 30 mins after I was supposed to check in.<br/>Host didn’t reply to multiple Airbnb messages, had to contact them via email address/phone number just so I could get into the apartment.<br/>I was told ‘keep the keys on you in case the door codes change or the door locks run out of battery.’ There were no keys.<br/>I asked about the keys every day and received reassurance to say ‘yes I will drop the keys round tomorrow’. No one turned up for 9 days, and no courtesy messages to say they wouldn’t be able to make it - literally just didn’t turn up. <br/>When they eventually did show up, I only received one key for main door building and no key for apartment door because they couldn’t find it. They also said they would be in the ‘very next day’ to set up the Apple TV, no one turned up, it was still not set up when I left. <br/>Such a shame because the apartment was lovely and spacious, location was great, there was a washing machine/dryer, but communication was so poor."

The room was so cute and cozy, Finn the cat was a total sweetheart and the neighborhood was absolutely charming. That would have been enough for five stars but then I was lucky enough to get to share coffee with Diana (and Finn) and learn about her story, and the story behind the unbelievable art in the house made by her and by her late husband. The hospitality was like our of a movie with a gentle kind innkeeper taking in weary travelers. I would not hesitate to stay here again and have already sent links to her listing to family members who also travel up their to visit our Albany cousins. Affordable, charming, gracious and comfortable. Stay here!"

8913,28868857,-471777573,2023-10-08,29407997,Philippe,Logement très bien situé avec un très bon rapport qualité-prix. Il manque cependant beaucoup de vaisselle et lorsqu'on cuisine sans ventilation et sans fenêtre ça sent rapidement la nourriture dans tout le logement. Beaucoup (un peu trop) de communications programmées à l'avance reçues du propriétaire mais difficile d'avoir des réponses simples à mes questions avant notre arrivée. J'ai dû lui écrire 3x pour savoir si la literie et les serviettes étaient fournies par exemple. Je recommande ce logement pour son emplacement et son prix pour 3 personnes mais il faudrait vraiment fournir plus que 3 ustensiles entre autres.

The location couldn't be better, right across the street from beautiful Washington Park and walking distance to cafes and restaurants.  Communication with Lloyd was excellent - he responded immediately to my texts.  I highly recommend Lloyds place!"

I would say that the front of the apartment does not do it any justice , and if you are planning to stay here be willing to go out of your comfort zone in decorative design! I had a great stay 😁. Might book again 🤷🏾‍♀️"
3298,11639446,188519644,2017-08-29,147194670,Zachariah,"Adam's place was awesome. So nice meeting the guy and spending an evening. I went to work on a project in private and Adam was extremely accomadating. I got a lot of work done, and Adam made me a spinach and rice dish and special dessert that honestly left me feeling refreshed and balanced. The place is quaint and welcoming. I put 4 stars for location because the area is a bit edgy. Nevertheless I have an open mind and was able to meet a nice neighbor and enjoyed a walk to a nearby park. Adam is very dedicated to this, as his cafe downstairs is purely for his guests! This was really eye opening to me. Adam obviously values giving and passion over profit and I value him for that."

The house is very quiet and I barely saw any of the other renters during my stay.  I had plenty of privacy. There are many common rooms to enjoy as well as enclosed front and back porches that were perfect for morning coffee/tea.  Off-street parking was available although I did not have a car with me. The place felt very cozy.  It is a very safe neighborhood with restaurants and a convenience store nearby.

The neighborhood is not fantastic, but it is located right near the highway and other tourist attractions. The kitchen is pretty minimal, but the listing included pictures so it wasn't a surprise.<br/>We had a couple minor issues, but the host was extremely responsive and dealt with them immediately.<br/>Overall, we had a good stay, and I would recommend it to someone else looking for a low cost place to stay."

The bed is super comfortable, and the washer/dryer are really convenient, especially for a long stay or if you're making a lot of stops on a long trip. It was really nice to have breakfast and coffee/tea included.<br/><br/>The apartment is in a convenient location downtown, close to the central shops, two parks, and easy access to the interstate. <br/><br/>We found it very easy to come and go and Molly was available by text to answer questions.

The house was clean and nicely decorated, and the bedrooms are upstairs, which made it easy to hang out after the kids were in bed. The neighborhood is very quiet, and close to cafes and restaurants on New Scotland. Allen was an excellent host - he responded quickly to our messages, and brought us an extra set of sheets when we asked for one. The only drawback of the house is that the beds aren’t super comfy - the master bed especially was a little saggy and soft for our middle-aged backs."

The bed is comfortable, bathroom and sofa bed were wonderful. There were extra linens, towels, and other stuff.  Location is incredible. Plenty of places to eat and a very wonderful neighbourhood. Most of the important places in an around the city was within walking distance. <br/>Kathryn is the most thoughtful, gracious host.

And also tried to resolve all issues.<br/>Some of the issues we had in our stay maybe an anomaly while some are likely not.<br/>The biggest issue that is likely not was noise between units.  While you may expect some noise, this was extreme and also late at night - video games played very loud past midnight downstairs and don’t want speculate what was going on upstairs between 3am-6am but every step could be heard through the ceiling.<br/>The biggest surprise (and most avoidable) was the unit was not clean - hairs, dirty bath rugs, not vacuumed rug in living room, food and stains on couches and chairs.   Linda sent the cleaners back and provided new bath rugs and other missing amenities - wash cloths and laundry detergent."

We have three young boys and they enjoyed the games and record player. We were able to walk to the nearby park and to get dinner. The neighborhood was a bit rougher than we expected. A neighbor played really loud music outside at 2 am and the bed was really firm, so we didn't sleep the best. Also, the floors are really creaky. Overall it was an ok experience, though I really appreciate the effort and care that Lori has put into her place."

13814,45529447,2074847230,2023-04-30,2316922,Nat,"Overall the stay at Linda’s place was easy and convenient. Short 5-10 mins Walking distance to the Albany Capitol centre, convention centre and Such which we needed to access for our event. Linda was very responsive and easy to get a hold of and check in was flexible and convenient.<br/>Street parking was super easy and there is also a lot that costs $10 a day to park in (cheaper than anywhere else) if you need something fast. <br/>This place easily would accommodate 4 people. It was just two of us and it was perfect for our needs. <br/>The only draw back I would say is this apartment is above a bar. Altho the patrons/workers are quiet they do smoke right below the windows of the apartment. And as such the apartment smells like cigarette smoke EVRRY time you enter. If you are very sensitive to smoke this might be a problem for you. <br/>Overall good and convenient stay close to everything we needed. And free street parking was a huge bonus!"

My only complaint was the front door to the apartment… The front door is made entirely of glass panels, which made us feel somewhat unsafe knowing someone could easily break the glass and unlock the door. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Linda’s Airbnb! <br/>The apartment is right next to an awesome Meadery, the Bull and Bee. They have wonderful mead, cider, and wine. Be sure to check out Pearl street for great restaurants, such as The Bishop, and a wonderful donut and coffee shop, Cider Belly Donuts. This Airbnb is also within walking distance of the Empire State Plaza, which is another must to check out while you’re in Albany!"

Fully equipped including washer/dryer—the place would work well for a longer -term stay. Very centrally located, with the awesome Iron Gate cafe a few doors down for breakfast or lunch, and the Dove&Deer around the corner a relaxing spot for dinner or drinks, plus all the idiosyncratic establishments on Lark St. the building has extra security features—make sure you get the directions from Dominick before arriving."

14099,46894493,-1954729821,2022-10-21,256054391,Tyler,"The Antique Bungalow was the perfect stay. It’s an easy drive from and to I-90 if you’re passing through town like I was. Everything  was VERY clean and the owners thought of everything down to clutch bottles of water in the fridge. Dan was very quick to respond, the driveway parking and keypad made check-in a breeze, and the place was lit up for us since we had a nighttime arrival. Big shower, comfortable beds, and endless food options nearby were everything we needed after long days of driving. This will be my repeat stay when passing through Albany."

7286,26139592,354872831,2018-12-02,46495997,Sahar,"Sue, their local contact person was very nice to communicate with and the location is very convenient when needing to be within walking distance of government offices at the New York State capitol. My only concern was the security of the space, in particular the lack of a lock on the door by the head of the bed through which it looks like someone could just walk into the apartment from outside through a small storage space that should be separated from the apartment with a 2-way lock for mutual security."
5449,22398196,369175895,2019-01-09,76970592,Melonie,great comfy room and I really enjoyed my stay here. Bela was kind enough to let me check in earlier which I really appreciate.

The space was clean and cozy, which made it easier to settle in. We couldn’t get over the attention to detail. There was time and effort put into each part of the home. The area is the perfect balance of privacy and accessibility. My Airbnb standards were definitely raised after this stay!"

The Keurig with lots of coffee and tea options was a nice touch. Nicely decorated and in a convenient location. With kids, we appreciated all the streaming channels available, no log in needed, along with string WiFi and 5G service. The owners were very responsive. Overall a good stay!"

Allen was an amazing host and very responsive in answering my questions even late at night. You need to take about 15-20 stairs to get to the apartment but since I had mention this booking was for my parents, Allen made sure to let me know about this before confirming the request. The place was very clean and organized and my parents will definitely book this again for their next visit."

8830,28868857,1701060130,2022-09-18,335593942,Arlen,"Check the reviews for what part of the building you are staying in. If staying in the “Garden Suite” know there is no garden access (that I was aware of), and as it stands is not quite a suite…it’s just a basement. Communication was great, accessing the building great, but the location is about a block away from a much rougher part of town, and the room itself is lit by uncomfortably aggressive fluorescent lights. This unit is the hand me down unit of all the others in the building. If you’re passing through for a night, it’s great how close it is to transportation and downtown, however, I will not be staying here on future trips to Albany."

Great proximity to local attractions and restaurants where you can feel like a local. Be aware that there is parallel street parking. I had time and felt pretty safe, so I enjoyed the walk when I parked 2-4 streets away, but something to consider. Overall, a great option when you visit Albany!"

It is within walking distance to Empire Plaza, the Cathedral and the Hill Street Cafe. The room is on the first floor and it is large and comfortable. The common area is somewhat cluttered. Gregg was hospitable and helpful with local tips and there was adequate communication. The building was built in 1846. We enjoyed the stay and would recommend, especially if you like historic buildings."

This house is lovingly decorated and the hosts are very responsive and understanding of a guest who was not able to arrive until quite late.  My pup knew instantly that the sofa at the foot of the bed was for her and slept so well that she was reluctant to get up when it was time to go.  Our experience was so positive that we have already booked another visit.  Thank you!

2556,10768745,192503392,2017-09-10,64191915,Fraz,This place was extremely comfortable even though the bed is a pull out couch it feels just like a bed and is paired with an extremely comfortable blanket and more pillows that you will know what to do with. Depending on body sizes it might be too small for two people. All the creature comforts are available in the room including a large TV. The decor made me feel right at home and super relaxed. I would definitely recommend this place for someone that needs a place to stay.

It was a quick and easy commute to the games in 10 minutes or so. Diana provided designated parking which was very convenient when visiting the City of Albany. The amenities in the apartment worked perfectly to keep my teenaged aged children entertained. We would definitely stay again for next year’s tournament."

The decor was lovely and one of my favorite things about Airbnb in general vs hotel rooms; you get to see so many unique spaces and see the personality the hosts inject into those spaces. Lloyd was responsive and gave great info and instructions. No issues at all and would 100% stay again!"
16974,52863776,-1339892534,2023-01-16,328495600,Justin,"Lloyd was very helpful and communicative.<br/>Please note that if you need the ‘third bed’ you must request it (air mattress) in advance. This was not noted on the listing, but Lloyd apologized and said he’d correct the listing."

Molly was very communicative, which I appreciated. Also features a perfect view of the Governor's Mansion, which is pretty cool for an out-of-towner like myself."

I do have to say the shower is amazing. <br/>Linda is there for you throughout the whole stay, like when I locked myself out of the apartment, the maintenance guy was there within 10 minutes to let me in. The door locks every time, don't leave the keys. She allows pets, which was great for me. <br/>The location is great. Access to major roadways is easy. There a great restaurant, Druthers (Get the Mac and Cheese), about a 10 minute walk down the road. There are parks nearby, even a dog park two blocks down the road."

I was in town for two days for meetings at the Capital, and the house is conveniently located to the government buildings as well as neighborhoods with restaurants and shops, etc.<br/>The apartment is exactly as pictured, and Gregg was quick to respond to my messages.  Check-in was super-easy, very comfortable bed."

The neighborhood, on the other hand, was definitely not the best. I wouldn't recommend going out past dark or by yourself. Large space for hanging out. Just a few blocks from the downtown area and capital building."

Convenient location, cozy apartment and quick and easy communication. Parking can be tough anywhere in Center Square if you’re not familiar with the area, especially with snow, but I was able to get on street parking both nights without issue. Would definitely recommend!"

Check in was very easy. Parking in front always had vacancies. The area is on a historical block, and retains its historical charm. Despite being next to tall on-ramps, I still got plenty of sun and was quiet at night."
9835,33558235,624093173,2020-05-06,331186604,Erich,The pictures do not do this space justice. There was way more room than expected. Everything was clean. Easy communication and keyless entry.<br/>The master bedroom is comfortable. <br/>The living room is set up for a fun family or friend night<br/>Right in downtown so hopping on the highway is easy. I will be staying here again

The neighbors were creepy though - some guy was lurking around in his car while we came out searching for our uber driver. He kept asking  if we were searching for our airbnb even after we turned him down and we got constant stares from neighbors that hung around outside all day. There's a lot of suspicious/crazy looking people everywhere, but we knew that coming up here so we don't walk around."

His cousin lives upstairs, and she was very nice and helpful, too. The internet only worked about half the time, and everything on the street can be heard from the main bedroom. Wonderful stay- it was exactly what we needed. It is not in the best area of town, but I never felt unsafe. "

The location is great, it’s right across the street from the park, and close to historical sites and the mall. The apartment itself is beautiful as it is an 1800s Brownstone, the ceilings and the details were so admirable. The place was clean and had many amenities that were easy to access and seamless communication with no issues at all. It was such a great place to get away and would definitely come back.

It’s not a fancy spot, but it does the job for a quick stay. <br/>We appreciated the soap, shampoo, conditioner, etc in dispensers in the bathroom.

It is a small house that has been recently renovated with love and care.  (And good taste!)  My friend  and I went out for drinks at two very nice restaurants just down the street.  So nice to not have to drive.  We stayed in and cooked both dinner and breakfast at the bungalow, and everything that we needed for cooking our meals was provided.   We brought our own salt and sugar and butter and coffee, just in case, but Dan had provided all of those items.  The bathroom is beautiful, with a large shower.  Dan accommodated our request for a later check out (at no charge)  which we very much appreciated. Highly recommended.  There was a bin for recyclable items, which is important to me."

We used this home to get ready for my wedding, and it couldn't have been more perfect (the natural light was amazing!) Dan was so helpful and kind and made sure we had everything we needed. I would recommend this place to anyone staying in the Albany area. Thanks again, Dan!"

8083,28722270,672646616,2020-10-09,193278254,Erica,"I booked Earl’s loft after being cancelled on last minute by another host. He was super quick to accept my reservation and provided me with details about the place immediately. Since I was in a rush to book, I only went by the pictures and price. It is very affordable and comfortably will fit 3-4 people. The loft itself has cute touches with faux plants and pictures, and overall is a unique space with brick/wood infrastructure. Keep in mind this place DOES NOT have an oven! This was my fault for not looking more into the listing, but we were able to use the toaster oven to cook our dinner. He provides essential cooking things like salt, pepper, oil, foil, glad plastic wrap, pots, silverware, dishes, etc. We did not use the TV but the Wifi worked great. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. He provides extra towels and little things if you forget like tampons, ibuprofen, mouthwash, and shampoo/conditioner. The shower has excellent water flow and there is shelving in bathroom to place your toiletries. The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but we felt very safe as there is a code to get into the front door and another dead bolted lock with a code to get to the loft. Overall, we had a great experience!"

For us, it comfortably fit two adults, one child, and a dog. The house is in a great location - near several shopping plazas, highway entrances, and the university - and it was easy to get anywhere we needed to be via car. The kitchen is well appointed, and the house has modern amenities. Peter was extremely responsive to my questions about our stay, both before and during. We hope to stay there again soon! 5 stars all around!"

20465,1268340907,1749964481,2023-05-14,12643012,Lorraine,"Purpose:<br/>First time in Albany for my sister’s graduation and needed a place to rest/recharge when not with family. We didn’t spend too much time in the Airbnb and this was at the right price point for just that. Getting ready and sleeping.<br/>Here’s my thoughts:<br/>Host:<br/>- Responsive, usually within a few hours.<br/>- Provided flexible check in since our flight landed early!<br/>- Allowed my guest list to be amended form 2 to 3 adults (unsure if I was required to ask since the listing says up to 4, but I wanted to be respectful).<br/>Home:<br/>- Located 10-15 minutes from everything! Albany seems big yet pretty accessible.<br/>- Street parking was abundant!<br/>- The apartment is upstairs on 2nd floor, accessed by the middle door. Pack light!<br/>- Homes in Albany are generally old. Although this place could use cosmetic updates (new tub, fixed door knobs, etc), it didn’t affect the main purpose of the stay.<br/>- Very quiet street! There was only one night of graduates celebrating. No big deal (sounded fun)."

The entrance smelled like wet dogs, the main living area smelled moldy and gross and there was clearly a tenant smoking cigarettes in his room but when I asked, Adam claimed the tenant just had cigarette smoke on his clothes. There is no way it was just ""on his clothes"". The whole floor reeked of cigarettes. The kitchen was frankly disturbing. There were moldy holes in the ceiling above the stove, the stove tops had weird black crusted bits of food piled in them and needed a deep cleaning. All the dishes needed a serious cleaning and had grease and food particles dried to them. The only pluses were the free breakfasts were edible, Adam is kind-hearted, and the shower is hot. But the whole main living quarters desparately needs cleaning and at night the neighbor turns his boombox up extremely loud every night and plays window-shaking hiphop to 12."

959,6623339,158853792,2017-06-08,75301385,Serge,"I cannot recommend this place.  The photos and the term ""restored"" make it look clean and new.  I am confounded in how it has 74 five-star reviews.  The pictures do not accurately portray the poor condition of this building and apartment.  The kitchen cabinets and appliances were clean enough, as well as the shower, sink, towels, linens, etc.  The bed, sofa, and dining table were new enough.  The problem is with the lack of maintenance and the old bones of the place:  the many many layers of paint, which you can smell, are peeling, the ac vents in disrepair, the baseboards and especially the windowsills are filthy, the carpet in the bedroom and closet is worn and dirty, the bedroom door doesn't close, and worst of all, there were large insects. The entry is dirty, the stairwell and grounds in disrepair.  It is on the second floor, not the first as implied in the photos.  The location is very walkable to lots of hip and interesting parts of Albany, but the price does not justify the condition of this place.      "

That makes it great because you can break up into separate areas rather than having to be in the same areas all the time. All the furnishings are sturdy and in pristine condition. The unit has an absolutely fabulous decor, is well maintained and is spotlessly clean. The hosts were very responsive and cooperative.

We bought proper plates, as well as a number of other items for the house (including a broom, hangers). The sofa and bed are a bit uncomfortable after a couple days.

They made us feel at home, with fresh coffee every morning. Cute dog too. Nice, soft beds, beautiful bathroom and good Entertainment/wifi. There was a misunderstanding when we arrived, as we thought we had booked the entire house, not just a single room. I guess we hadn't looked thoroughly at the print, and more at the pictures. But John sorted this out by giving us a discount on the second room we needed for our stay. There is a Family run restaurant right across the street which serves good, authentic vietnamese food. Nice bagels and coffee at the Hudson river coffee house, two blocks away. "

However just a few things that need to be fixed. Such as the pillows had spikes, and there wasn’t no fridge or coffee pot as shown on the pictures. I attempt to communicate with host and ehh wasn’t really communicating at all. I wouldn’t mind visiting again and stay at Sonya’s."

Efrat  and Dan were very welcoming and had no problems with us bringing our 9 mo old son. We had the whole bottom level to ourselves which included a bathroom and living area.

We appreciate the very convenient location and the super comfortable bed.  It was a bit smaller than we expected but fine for a place to sleep.

15285,50207226,-1283416094,2023-07-16,506759476,Arpan,"If you're looking at a short stay no need to read more. This place is perfect!<br/>For guests who are looking for a longer stay (we stayed there for 6 weeks, for a work trip) read on.<br/>I'll begin with the biggest pro. Linda was extremely responsive and always available to address any issues that we may have had. If we needed something she would order those for us immediately.<br/>The loft-style apartment was decorated very aesthetically and has new appliances. the bathroom has a walk in shower which was much much appreciated.<br/>The only thing which kind of dampened our stay was the mattress which was very uncomfortable. it would have been fine if we were there for a couple of days but sleeping on that for 6 weeks caused bad back issues for both of us. Hopefully this is something that will be addressed in the future.<br/>also, there were a couple of mouse issues towards the end of our stay which were promptly addressed. It's New York so I guess that's nothing new."

The apartment was quite spacious, and we could't have wanted a more convenient location. We were delighted to find a bookshelf with books and DVDs that we could use, and the kitchen had everything that we needed for breakfast. Terra promptly remediated our few, minor complaints: nighttime noise from a neighboring business and weak WiFi signal in the living area. We would certainly stay there again and recommend it to others."
518,3820211,534294787,2019-09-22,40427970,Renee,We rented Terra's place for a quick overnight stay as we were in town for a show at the Times Union Center. Her instructions were thorough just prior to our check in time. She was responsive when I had a quick question. The location was close enough to walk to several restaurants and to the concert venue. The apartment itself was pretty basic but worked for us for a quick trip to Albany!

15902,51592836,-1565179197,2022-07-21,470076880,Devan,"Beautiful building. Classic accents like original carved molding. Cleaned and well maintained. Comfortable furniture. Very spacious if you’re staying with a partner or single companion. Place came with a guide of local hotspot recommendations on the table near the entryway. Toiletries were stocked. Host is courteous and good with communication. On my stay he/they were traveling so that accounted for a very small delay in response time. <br/>A couple of small nitpicks would be (and maybe this first one is more my fault than the host’s) but as my girlfriend (local to Albany) pointed out, beware that a lot of brownstones don’t have forced air a/c systems because of their age, so as in this case the best you may get is a small window unit. Our widow a/c unit was a little on the older side, and it struggled to keep the small space cooled even at full power. <br/>When I parked outside of the building, a neighbor who had assumed I was a passerby leaving my car in residential parking left a hostile note taped to my windshield. I was a little confused given that I was staying at one of the buildings, and the street signs didn’t seem to clarify the matter. When I asked about parking ahead of time, the host said it was street parking and that was that. <br/>All in all, I give the place 4/5 mostly just because of the a/c. Good pick."

This Airbnb is perfect for that- clean but no frills, a place to lay your head. Walkable to bars and restaurants with plenty of street parking (only ~$6/day on the local parking app).<br/>If you need a place that fits “your aesthetic,” this ain’t it.

I was able to park my car and walk to all of the important venues in the area. The unit is spacious and comfortable. I'm sure to look u Gregg again next time.

4822,20519885,-1986075558,2022-09-17,231126015,Allan,"We stayed at MIchael and Flerida's house for a family reunion of a group of 7 adults.  Our hosts were very gracious and responded quickly to some requests we had for some things for the house.  The house was very spacious for our group and the big dining room table was our main gathering place.  It is conveniently located to get to downtown Albany and grocery shopping etc. was close by.  Having said that the neighborhood is a little ""transitional"", although there is a very nice neighborhood just a couple of blocks away and also a nice park with a small lake.  The house is older and has character, but could use a thorough dusting. Overall the house worked well as for our group and as a home base for trips up and down the Hudson River Valley"

The apartment was conveniently located to downtown Albany, the area felt safe, and checking in was a breeze, especially since the side street that you park on is right next to the entrance.  My stepdaughter stayed in the sofa bed in the living room, and told us she really liked having so much space to herself. Personally, I had a lot of fun using a Chemex coffee maker for my first time :-). I just can't think of a better value for such a great spot. Many thanks to Jake for having us!"
454,3820211,268966450,2018-05-26,15931660,Claire,"Terra's space was great for our 2 night stay. Our late night arrival did not impact our check-in as she had a self check-in set. As warned, the bar next door was an expected additional noise (and some additional smells...), but she provided a noise machine that I liked so much I kind of want one of my own. I did a load of laundry at her place, which was a nice option as we had multiple destinations on this trip. We finally did discover some washcloths in her dryer, as we were looking for those on our first night. Location was great, local places to grab breakfast, etc. We felt safe and comfortable throughout our stay. Very cool building and clean space!"

However, when i would get back home, hoise had everything starting from a mini fridge, comfortable bed in a private room, lots of outlets, clean bathroom, private walkin closet with a nice door mirror. I forgot to bring my steamer for clothes and was happy and relieved when i found that Hasan had an iron in closet.

99,1489424,107429114,2016-10-10,48958045,Vadim,"The best thing about Efrat and Dan's place is that you get the whole bottom floor with a very specious bedroom and toilet+shower so the stay is very private. Bed feels like you're sleeping on a cloud. Efrat and Dan were very kind but we didn't get to speak to them much as we arrived late and left early. Location was easy for us (we were driving and parking is plentiful in the street but can't say how it is if you aren't driving). Ony thing to consider, which might not be OK for everyone is that you do get a sense that it is somebody's house. That is,  the area you live in is not as tidy as a museum. But it is clean, comfortable and home-like, just something to consider if you are looking for a hotel-like experience. We had a great time and definitely recommend the stay."

Plenty of beds and linens.  Very well-supplied kitchen, dining room seats 8, perfect for family meals.  Lovely stairs down to creek view in back.  Off-street parking.<br/>Minor bad points:  The large number of posted reminder signs detract from relaxation.  The decor and furnishings are all older:  usable, but used."

We had initial difficulty in contacting the host...until we used my son who lives in Albany to be the contact, as we were relying on internet connection where ever we found free wifi..as roaming charges for international tourists is prohibitive. He went to the apartment a few times on the day we were yo arrive into JFK bit could not gain access...he was trying to get key so that he could leave basic provisions for us there. He eventually got an answer to the door bell..late evening.  The apartment was adequate for them as they spent most of their time with their brother who lives in Albany. They did say that the apartment was way too warm, and they could not see where to set the heating. One of the windows was broken but had plastic/perspex over it. The furniture was of a good enough standard but the couch was a little shabby and their was a musty smell from it. Other than those  facts they said the place was ideal for them and the contact person was very obliging considering they locked themselves out once and needed access ."

Very comfortable queen bed (we didn't use the twin). Private back door entrance. Easy parking (driveway).<br/>cons (nit-picky, but worth a mention): You can hear the upstairs neighbor walking, doing dishes, etc.  just because it's an old house, and this only occurred during the day. also, the bathroom vanity is really small so it's hard to navigate where to place your toiletries. we used the little hallway closet. <br/>Again, we really were pleased overall and would recommend to others!"

There are some downsides though:<br/>1- really steep stairs to access the place.<br/>2- free parking on the street but you need to move it every two hours between 8am -6pm Monday to Friday<br/>3-one bed is not comfortable and slanted. <br/>4- All widows have blinds but there is a lot of light from the street that still comes in.<br/>5- it is a little noisy at night because of the busy street.<br/>All that said, if it is only two of you, you can’t beat the price and location and I would stay there again."

The owner sweared there had never been a cat in the apartment, but the sticker on the front door says otherwise. She blamed the smell on the previous tenant cooking onions. Onions don't smell of catpiss. I love onions and know exactly how they smell.<br/><br/>The apartment is in a basement and it was only possible to open one window, which was a problem because of the previous tenant - the cat.<br/><br/>The shower smelled of mold.<br/><br/>Other then owner being disingenuous and the smells the place was good. Nice decor etc."

A small fan was provided, but a longer extension cord would be helpful to blow the air on the bed. It’s been unseasonably hot, so this would not usually be an issue. My daughter stayed here in winter and it was cozy. I recommend it! The shower was nice! Also I recommend a visit to Cider Belly doughnuts if you can!"

As an Albany Native, this area can get very loud at night as college kids and the like tend to the festivities and bars on Lark street. I was fortunate it was quiet: the room is on the top floor so noise was not an issue and we slept soundly. Adem put a tremendous amount of love and hard work in this and it shows: everything was new, courtesies to the guest were left throughout the abode.  It was a bit of climb to the top floor so any of those with older joints be aware you need to be physically able to climb the short 2 flights.  I would definitely stay here, and the best part?  There's some of the BEST pizza in Albany on the first floor! Thank you again!"

10365,34330970,294446392,2024-02-07,32205708,Brendan,There's a punching bag and a Street fighter Arcade videogame in addition to the pool table. The Jacuzzi is nice but make sure you fill it half way with cold water first before using the hot water so this way you don't run out of hot water at the end of filling. It takes about a half hour to fill the Jacuzzi so make sure you fill it ahead of time before you plan on bathing.

I am traveling with a hitch basket on my vehicle with my belongings. I had to park a bit far and I couldn’t keep an eye on my stuff. It was safe but still just a little annoying.

Jake was great with communication and, while I had no problems while I was there, I'm sure that he would've been right on top of anything I needed. There was ample parking and the neighborhood has a lot of families who pretty much just do their thing. I had no noise issues but you are in the city so you will hear the very occasional siren or motorcycle. All in all, it's a great place - thanks, Jake!!"

The parking space is a nice bonus. As other reviewers state, its proximity to nightlife can make it a bit noisy, but this was not a problem during my stay -- the area was quiet at bedtime. The building itself is very quiet. Check-in was straightforward and convenient. The space is furnished very nicely, and the bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. I highly recommend this stay and will definitely be back!"

This was my mother's childhood home - it was so special to be able to stay there and to see her revisit so many moments in her memory. It's a very old, classic home that Diana has updated to match today's standards. The complimentary snacks were welcomed after long travels from out of state. The kitchen, bathrooms and 5 bedrooms easily fit 7 adults and 5 children. We 'lived' in every room, including dinner around the ample dining room table, cards and couch time in the family room and even some great, relaxing time on the patio! The game room on the third floor was awesome - such a fun place for everyone to spend time, especially the kids. We were so grateful for the opportunity to stay here and would love to return again some day!"

Usually it’s a 70-80min wait for a table but if you check in online and then show up 45 later, they’ll give you a table <br/>When we asked about our baby crawling around and how safe that would be, Lloyd made sure to remove any decorations or breakables from her reach and left a pack and play with clean sheets for her!<br/>Cons<br/>-really nothing that isn’t disclosed, parking is annoying but Lloyd tells you exactly the hours you can park and where. That’s a Albany issue not a host issue<br/>-there’s no washer/dryer in unit, but there’s a coin laundry within walking distance"

Only problem is it’s on an OK street at night, right on the sidewalk level, on a corner, so shades have to be drawn at all times, and street noise makes you feel a bit exposed. Otherwise place is nice-sized and clean, within walking distance to downtown."

The leather couch in the living room was just as comfortable as the pull out bed stored within it. The master bedroom sets comfortability was only outdone by its beauty. The place was sparkling clean, inviting, and trendy.... amazing is an understatement... Allen as a host sets the bar... his communication, willingness to help, and down to earth personality made our stay even better. We had a family matter at Albany Med and offered us early checkin and late check out, to assist with our situation. This place is A++++ and is made even better by its Host. Highly recommended. Thank you for everything Allen."

3526,12284708,175703442,2017-07-29,118701184,Elizabeth,"I stayed at Nick's for two months. The house is in the Pine Hills neighborhood of Albany and very close to the college of Saint Rose. The neighborhood may seem dodgy in some areas, but I generally felt safe walking alone to and from downtown everyday (25-30min walk, faster by bus).<br/>When I first arrived at the house, I was disappointed to find that my room hadn't been swept in quite a while, and there were dishes in the sink from the last AirBnB'er. I was disappointed to find the fridge had many containers of moldy food that needed to be thrown out awhile ago. I don't expect the place I stay to be spotless, but a bit more attention to detail would have made my initial impression more positive. I brought these issue up to Nick, and he assured me that the housekeeper was scheduled to come soon (and she did).<br/>Nick was very responsive to messages, and had no problem helping me or the others guests with any issues that came up during our stay. A couple of times the power went out in the kitchen, and Nick was quick to fix it.  "

She was very prompt when replying to my text messages. There was plenty of parking on the street available.

Quiet neighborhood. A few areas were experience could have been better: the shower was very narrow and you can bump your head going in and out; you can hear footsteps from people walking above. Overall though, a good experience and I'd stay there again."
8862,28868857,201973755,2023-02-26,97541274,Mary,The place was what was expected for a basement room. It was a little weird there was what I believe was another room right next door and there was a door inside our room to the next room and there was a space under the door that went right to that room. No one was in it at night but someone came in the morning and turned on the light and then left pretty soon after getting there. The walls are really thin as said in the posting. We were there for a show so as well as the upstairs neighbors so the noise didn't bother us but if you are trying to get to bed early it's probably not the place for you because you will be able to hear conversation going on from upstairs. It was a little bit of a strange place but I wasn't bothered by it and did the job of us having a place to stay.

It feels like hostel living, in a good way. It's a charming old flat above a cafe, where you can enjoy the meals Adam prepares for you, according to your wishes. He couldn't be a more accommodating, gracious, welcoming host. I'm not in this part of the country very often, but if I ever am again, I'll hope there's space here. "

Everything was new and sparkling. <br/>The living room has a humongous smart t.v. and a sectional that makes chilling very easy. <br/>The bathroom was incredibly clean and the towels were fluffy. I was thrilled to see the washer and dryer combo as well. <br/>The bedroom has great amber-colored lighting, a comfortable bed and ample closet space. <br/>The place even has a smaller room with a nice desk and chair that makes remote working a breeze. There’s also a yoga mat in this room, just in case you leave yours at home. <br/>For parking, there is an attached parking lot right behind the unit, with your own private parking space.<br/>As for location, Erion’s AirBnB is a short walk away from Albany’s Washington Park. This a beautiful park that was designed by Frederick Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in the late 1800s. <br/>Finally, there is the superstar host Erion! 🤩 He is a stellar person who really cares about making sure you have a pleasant stay. <br/>If you are in the Albany, NY area, you should definitely stay at this AirBnB!👍👍👍"

17086,53312101,1083017923,2023-03-19,17181976,Butch,"Once you got in the apartment, it was *beautiful* and the photos do not do it justice. Huge windows that let in so much natural light, comfy couches, spacious bathroom...felt quite nice! Water bottles and coffee were left for us and everything felt clean and pristine. <br/>The area left little to be desired. The building is next to a police station, housing authority, rescue mission, and tons of closed businesses. This is not Diana's fault though, as once you got into the building, you feel secure and safe. The parking lot was not very secure, and someone was using the hood of my car as a place to put their wares as they were passing through. <br/>Diana's guidebook was incredibly outdated, as most of the restaurants listed are permanently closed. You are close to a lot of good restaurants...you just have to do a bit of leg work ahead of time. <br/>Diana was a DELIGHT to work with, though. Relatively fast responding via text, very kind and patient, and took care of us! I recommend this place."

The lovely loft is very spacious, even more so than it looks in the listing photos. The cleanliness was impeccable, and the beautiful decoration really made it feel like a home away from home. As someone who was in town to take the bar exam at the Albany Capital Center, the location was perfect for me. It was just a 10-minute walk away (or a 3-minute drive), which made my morning commute a breeze. Overall, I would highly recommend this loft to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay in Albany."

It could definitely use a good cleaning though (which is more reflective of the cleaning crew opposed to the host).   Also, be cognoscenti of the price when booking.  There were some comps just a couple blocks away that were slightly bigger and had an AirBnB “enhanced clean” badge for just a couple extra dollars.  Again, overall though, a decent little unit."

The apartment is comfortable, spacious, nicely decorated and with comfortable furniture.  We could see a garden like area out the back window but we could not find access to it. There was plenty of light, and the apartment was cool even without the air conditioning.  We felt secure in the neighborhood, and it had a lot of interesting architecture and restaurants/bars. There is a beautiful, very large park nearby within easy walking distance. There was a fair presence in the neighborhood of people who seemed either on or in need of drug treatment but other than asking for small donations they were in no way threatening.  Brian helped us obtain permit parking near the apartment and that was very helpful.  We would recommend this apartment to other airbnb guests who are comfortable in an urban setting."

It’s in a lovely setting on a small park in a very nice neighborhood. Everything needed for a short or long stay is included … even use of an unground pool. It’s a great use of space with all the essentials to cook your own meals. The bed is super comfy. There is a great TV (with a Netflix account). Liz’s communication was always prompt and helpful."

A historical brownstone apartment so the interior is a bit aged. Only reason for criticism is that the bed frames need to be replaced due to loud squeaking.

Location wise it’s close to MVP Arena which was great for us since we came for an event. Precinct right up the block. Not much around to walk to, but good restaurants 10 minutes away. Place comes with parking spot right across the street, very convenient. We did find someone parked in the spot one night so we had to find street parking. Overall good experience!"

I would hands down recommend this place when visiting Albany (except when we’re visiting because I’d love to book this place again next time lol). Some of the highlights include: secure front door and entrance to the apartment; quiet street; nice neighborhood across from the park; clean/soft towels and linens; coffee/creamer with coffee machine; full kitchen stocked with basics like oil and some spices so I didn’t need to purchase or risk a mess in my luggage when traveling with it; comfy bed and futon; etc.. As I write this list I realized I enjoyed everything. There was actually nothing I would change so I’ll leave you with this… I highly recommend this place or others with the same owner for your next trip to Albany! Cheers."

Bring dishwasher soap if you want to use the dishwasher.<br/>Bed was very comfortable. Big closet with shelves and hanging space;  our large suitcase fit in a corner of it.<br/>Bathroom had good storage. <br/>Nice, new washer and dryer; bring your own laundry soap.<br/>We thought it was very nice that shampoo & conditioner,  coffee, creamer, & sugar, tissues & paper towels were provided.<br/>The HVAC is in another apartment,  so we could not control th he heat. With outside temps in the 40s, it was always chilly. I wore my coat during the day and a sweater over my pjs at night, piling extra sheets, a towel, and my shawl on the bed to stay warm.<br/>Communication wasn't great. To get the front door code on check in day and to ask about the heat, I'd get no response to email until I also texted."
6536,25549565,317714745,2018-09-02,140654230,Christina,Janet's place is great for a short-term stay. It has the coziest little couch as soon as you walk in and the bed is comfy. The surrounding area has nice little shops and restaurants so you'll definitely enjoy your time here.

Plenty of parking, and the Pourhouse, Juniors and Kizmet are excellent and 2 minutes walk away. Apartment is cosy and comfortable, close to downtown, interstate and malls. If you’re looking for somewhere central in Albany, this ticks all boxes. Allen will quickly respond to all messages, incredibly helpful and friendly."

We felt comfy in all rooms and enjoyed the hot tub every evening. Great central location to do the tourist stuff yet good choice if traveling for other agendas.
8377,28722270,169336397,2023-07-26,518746156,Ashley,Earl was incredibly kind and responsive throughout the planning and duration of my stay! I didn’t feel the most comfortable or safe at the location- there was actually an incident involving gunshots down the street- except when in Earl’s apartment (exterior building and interior unit locks made the place feel secure). Thank you Earl for your hospitality!

2132,9501054,91894029,2016-08-07,35392155,Joshua,"Great room, looks and comes as promised. Parking is on the street which may be difficult to find a free space but Gregg has a garage to use in case. The bedroom door needs a key whenever you open and close it, which can be annoying sometimes, but it's good safety if you are a cautious person. The house is about a 20-second walk from a cafe/bar which is convenient if you need a drink or food nearby. Gregg was very responsive to messages and helpful with everything. Would recommend."

Was able to book easily and in a location that was convenient for us. Unit was clean, cute and comfortable. Was exactly as describe and the additional amenities like bottled water, coffee, creamer, biscotti, full sized bath products and dog dish were added bonuses. The place was perfectly clean and nicely decorated. Will definitely use again when we are back in the area. Diana was very proactive even though we had no needs or issues while staying."

13651,45529316,-256470308,2021-10-11,70207440,Sheri,"My boyfriend and I had originally booked one of Linda’s other units for a two night stay when visiting to run the Mohawk River Half Marathon.  Linda requested we change our reservation to this unit so that she can accommodate the guest who wanted to extend their long term stay in the original unit we booked. Not a huge deal…<br/>Overall, our stay was good. The apartment is modern and clean. Originally I was a bit disappointed that off street parking was no available but on street parking was easy to find and not a hassle so it ended up not being an issue. <br/>We enjoyed dinner just down the block at Cafe Capriccio as well as takeout from Rain Modern Chinese. Enjoyed a walk to Lark Street for coffee and viewing of the great architecture of the old buildings. <br/>The building is in a great location in terms of being close to downtown, however one block over is very sketchy but most cities have an area that isn’t that great - so this wasn’t a huge issue - we just avoided walking down that one block. <br/>Apartment was clean, looked just like the photos. Minimal silverware and uncomfortable couch - not a huge issue for us - but could be for some staying longer than two nights. <br/>Linda was great with communication leading up to our stay and following checkout. Seamless check-in and check-out process.<br/>Thanks for hosting us Linda!"

4622,19571496,405182956,2019-01-26,106468095,Giulio Fernando,"The house was really comfy!<br/>It's a common wood house in Albany with all the basics needed for a comfort living.<br/>It's big and the bed is reaaaaaaally comfortable. The couch is also comfortable but not as much as the bed haha. But it was no problem sleeping on the couch, also!<br/>There will be more people in the house, so you're going to meet new people from other places, too! The people we met were amazing and it was really fun talking to them. There's just one bathroom (idk if there are more upstairs).<br/>It is possible to hear the noises of the steps upstairs, but people will take off their shoes when in the house, thus the sound is decreased. Bring flip flops!<br/>The amenities (toilet paper, towel, blankets, etc.) were clean and good!<br/>One really good point is that Chad is always up to helping when needed. I needed help from him late at night and he responded within seconds to my messages. <br/>The house's location is perfect! There's everything near: stores, bus stops, pubs..."

11642,39864828,319572117,2023-07-27,48427428,Robin,"We loved our stay here.  It was comfortable and well supplied.  Comfortable mattresses and pillows, lots of towels and well-stocked kitchen.  We didn’t have to buy little things like laundry detergent, dryer sheets or coffee pods.  Matt was very responsive when we contacted him.   The neighborhood was fun.   Lots of breweries and a short 5 minute drive to downtown.  We would stay here again if visiting Albany."

1305,8915877,52369580,2015-10-28,47057302,Ashley,"We stayed with Molly for one night while in town to see a show at The Egg. The apartment was large, spotless, and comfortable, with cozy blankets and scented candles. We got the key from a lockbox on the property, eliminating the need to coordinate meeting up. The fridge was stocked with breakfast foods and coffee, which was a really nice bonus. Something else that we liked that wasn't mentioned in the listing: the unit had a washer and dryer, which we didn't need to use, but longer-term travelers might appreciate. Making the reservation was easy and Molly was extremely comminicative and friendly. I feel like I got a great deal- a peaceful 1br for the price of a boring Days Inn. I would recommend her apartment to anyone traveling through the area!"

18749,-1166811729,1393803458,2022-08-28,460629507,Barbara,"I am surprised by all the five star reviews. I actually wound up leaving early because I was not comfortable in the house. The high ceilings are great but there is no art, and no floor lamps or reading lamp in the bedroom so the only lighting are very stark bright white lights. Although it’s been remodeled recently, it’s not a very well done job and there are signs everywhere of work badly done, spots of paint on the floor, tape stuck to the toilet, and cable wires sticking out of the wall. <br/>There’s no instruction book on how to work the TV and climate control units. No hand towels or any kitchen amenities except for an offbrand Keurig and some knives and plastic plates and glasses. <br/>For women traveling alone and anyone in general two blocks down to the right when you come out is really not safe especially after dark. I had nightmares all night my first night."

11393,39836487,-1836408560,2023-07-13,227437935,Darci,This was a great apartment for the price I paid. It was only me who stayed but could also work for a couple or 2 very close friends. It’s in a convenient location to explore Albany.

10600,35914565,746831127,2021-04-08,341737161,Nicholas,This place was beyond expectations and was just overall amazing. I thought that it would be a much smaller place but it was pretty nice and spacious. Apparently from the review the jacuzzi doesn’t always work so be sure to check in with the host (it didn’t work for us).The place might look “sketchy” but it’s not. We had no problems and the parking spot was very nice. 10/10 recommend.
8576,28868857,586266979,2020-01-01,135374207,Aidan,Very hospitable and clean space very close to downtown. Very comfortable and affordable. My friend and I very much enjoyed our stay and would definitely do it again.
7708,28400263,237552405,2023-07-18,35878030,Emma,Nice neighbourhood a little bit away from the center. Friendly hosts with a cute dog :-)
1795,9005989,434180395,2019-04-07,58381142,Jessica,"Sue’s place fit our needs well. We were in town for a quick family gathering and needed to stay somewhere dog friendly. There is a large park (with an off leash area) at the end of the street that we were able to walk our dog in, although FYI if you’re interested it isn’t a park that I’d wander through at night. The WiFi was spotty- it worked sometimes and others not. The TV is a roku, so works through WiFi, so we never really got it to be able to stream anything. It didn’t bother us- we weren’t there to watch TV, just like to leave background noise on for the dog. The apartment itself is cute and really clean. It is a basement apartment. Within walking distance there are a handful of bars, cafes, and even a little juicery about 10 minutes away. It seems like the area is a developing, trendy spot."

1964,9005989,-1678362858,2021-08-13,192849292,Megan,"Great location with lots of food and shops in the area. Easy to find and check in. Typical city parking which was expected and not an issue. Only issue was cleanliness tbh and I’m not a clean freak by any means. Nothing noticeable at first glance but when going to use things in kitchen many of the cabinets were significantly dirty inside, anything you would need to use would definitely need to be thoroughly cleaned before being used in the kitchen....   old batteries and used dirty napkins just thrown in lazy Susan with lots of dirt/dust and random crumbs etc like they haven’t been wiped down in some time . Also old used face mask in bedside desk which was.....gross tbh with the current state of things. Old half eaten ice cream containers in freezer and random used small food items in fridge. All in all could use a deep clean but just at first glance appears clean without further inspection. Also no smoke detector. Just an empty bracket where one should be. If this place was clean it would be a 5 star location and rental but it really needs a good cleaning. <br/>We only stayed one night just to crash and get up early and go so there was no point in voicing an issue at 11pm when we arrived when we were leaving at 8:30 the following morning."
2629,10768745,280146002,2018-06-22,17736630,Alan,Charming house with off street parking. Elizabeth was very communicative and made sure I enjoyed my stay. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Albany.

12261,42391372,663882079,2020-09-13,55287621,Garrick,Very helpful and responsive host. Home is located in a very convenient part of downtown Albany with easy access to many sightseeing locations.
4816,20519885,1976823799,2022-07-25,103217497,Randell,"It is an older house with lots of charm. We brought the family to town for a wedding, and this allowed us all to stay together."
12111,42009788,1781740407,2023-05-30,105909527,Ro,"Overall my stay does not seem representative of the hosts reviews from other guests. Had a booking on a different listing, at a discounted rate for the stay. Day before check-in, host requested listing change through app of accept or decline(no messages prior). I declined. Day of travel host said the listing was ""unfortunately due to unforeseen circumstances The original unit you selected is unavailable."" I accepted the change. Got to the unit quite late after day of flights. The rear door was completely unlocked, and looked like it had previously been broken into. Led to a very creepy staircase with people talking. The unit did not reflect the unit I had previously reserved and there was no change in cost. The previous unit was able to be reserved that same night at a higher price. Airbnb refunded  and cancelled the rest of my stay."
22015,1177818286,-639229880,2024-02-16,441131422,Carissa,"The house was clean and in great condition. However, if you’re looking for a quiet night this wouldn’t be the perfect place because it’s located on a main road in downtown Albany. The Roku remote for the tv did not work so I had to watch tv on my phone."

Clean and comfy bed and wonderful bedding. Lots of windows and great light. Lots of little complimentary snacks. <br/>Parking was a little tough to try to figure out at first but idk if it's always like that. And it's a noisy corner with general urban sounds, but again to be expected with location.<br/>I quite enjoyed my stay here all in all"

The host was kind and very helpful with my luggage as the rooms in his home were on the up stairs level. Room was provided in the refrigerator for me to keep a few personal items cold, which was helpful as I was traveling.  I would highly recommend a stay at this lovely airbnb.

The neighborhood is lovely and quiet but still walkable to stuff. The backyard was great for our little one to run around and we got tons of use out of the grill and porch - the upper level off of the master bedroom was particularly lovely with two great chairs for lounging! The kitchen was well stocked for cooking, the Roku's on all the TV's made it so easy to sign into our usual streaming service accounts. The Bedrooms were REALLY comfortable - great bed linens, pillows and mattresses! But the highlight of this place, especially at this time of year was the FANTASTIC AC! The place stayed cool all day every day! Great communication from the host and great hospitality! Would recommend to anyone!"

Plenty of space for everyone, TV's in each room loaded up with Netflix, Hulu etc. Great kitchen and dinning room table to make dinners if you are not looking to eat out. Dunkin Donuts and CVS 2 blocks away was nice if you need a quick coffee or drugstore run. Their home is stocked up with all you need for a comfortable stay. The kitchen has everything you need for cooking, spices, basic condiments and plenty of pots and pans. Lovely neighborhood too, would definitely recommend to a friend. Thanks Michael and Flerida!"

It was a perfect mix of comfort and constant visual stimulation. You could spend a week there and not look at everything. The pool and patio were as great as you’d expect and the top floor we stayed in was very charming and comfortable. <br/>I would definitely stay here again.

No complaints at all.

Bus 114 will take you from the Amtrak station to just a very short block from the apartment (cdta . org).  It’s on a residential block, but great coffee, plenty of restaurants, and a decent supermarket are all within five minute walks.  It suited my needs so perfectly, I’ve booked the apartment for a return visit."

Top choice for Albany. The only feedback I have is that I would have liked a dresser. Maybe replace the TV stand with one because my stay was a bit longer than most and I didn’t have a great place to store/arrange clothes. Still a 10/10 though because everything that was there was great."

7264,25976514,283328023,2018-06-29,115044972,Christopher,"What a fantastic stay. Leiba welcomed me in, had some food ready for me, which I had not even anticipated. I had dinner with her and her daughter and they are sweet and charming company. I was practically given the run of the house. I watched a Yankee game in the living room. In the bedroom I had another TV I did not use but had a Firestick and Netflix. There was also an AC in the bedroom that came in clutch because temperatures were in the 90’s. The whole house, my bedroom, the bathroom I used were immaculately clean. After one night I had come back late, Leiba told me the next day she had been concerned about me (so charming). The morning I checked out, she had made delicious banana muffins. And while Leiba is sociable when engaged, the whole house was very quiet and peaceful when we were not in conversation.<br/>Leiba is awesome! I’m actually worried this review is going to hold her to too high a standard!"

He always responds promptly at any hour, even while he was away on vacation, and quickly resolved any concerns that were addressed. The property was totally accurate to the listing and photos, and was also pristine down to the corners of the bathroom. I have already booked another property listed under him and am glad I was able to catch it in time, given that his prices are unbeatable and the units are great. For any other traveling workers such as myself, I highly recommend booking with Mike if you're looking for longer-term lodging in the capital region."

It was fairly easy to check in. The space was accurate to the photos, had the listed amenities, and is a good place if you come to Albany for a short trip! <br/>The only things I’d say are that if you stay here, it would be best to check in during the day and not at night (we arrived closer to midnight due to travel time and the neighborhood wasn’t the safest as we were approached by some homeless people down the st; we later did more research and saw that the area a few blocks down to the right was a bit dangerous to be around). There were also a stain on the desk, and we found strands of hair left over on the bed when we had arrived. It was very hard to sleep at night because of the family living upstairs (they’re very loud)! The backdoor being next to the bed also made me worry. The shower could also use a curtain- other than that it was a good experience."

It made a great home away from home, and Chris was very helpful when we needed to extend our stay.  The home was much larger than expected - 4 bedrooms plus an office/baby room.  My son loved the toys.  The location is perfect.  The neighbors were super nice and we enjoyed hearing the mini waterfall in the back of the house.  Very convenient location to stay and we will consider it when we are back in the area for holidays and events.  Thanks, Chris!"

Whenever I had a question, Michael responded within minutes and was extremely proactive. George who helps maintain the property was great too. Always friendly and willing to help.

There was an unforeseen event at the listing we originally booked, but Diana was able to host us at another one of her properties without any disruption, inconvenience, or price change at all. I would not hesitate to stay at one of Diana's properties again!"

The room that Liz had available was quiet, in a great location in a peaceful neighborhood, close to shops, restaurants, and the school. The off street parking pot was convenient. Liz was a great host - flexible, accommodating and thoughtful - she put a table in the room for me to use as a workspace. <br/>"

Even with someone else decor or furniture staying there makes you feel like you picked everything. Attentive host with a warm kind and nurturing heart. I really would put this at the highest bars and other should follow. I really loved staying and I already miss it. If you are looking for somewhere to stay for real look no further. If you do look further you are missing out on gold."

Wallpaper and paintings and clutter (including collection of unwatchable VCRs - sadly no books!) give it a feel of staying at a grandparent's house. The place was very easy to find, right off the highway, and the location was lovely and calm for a brief overnight stay. Would have appreciated a porch light when arriving at night, but the directions were clear and easy to follow. The nearby neighborhood seem to be charming."

12105,42009788,-1307108679,2022-06-23,245711398,Alexis,"I stayed with Elizabeth for almost 4 months. Pros: First, let me say Elizabeth is WONDERFUL to work with. Quick communication and very accommodating. Really can’t beat the unit location and the apartment has just what you need for cooking etc. Neighborhood is safe and relatively quiet. Attractions are blocks away to 10min walk at most.<br/>Cons: Personally, I felt the monthly price was a little steep. But unfortunately that seems to be the norm among short term rentals in the area.<br/>I would absolutely recommend this place. And yes, I would stay again."
13215,44265426,1853751037,2023-05-17,370121779,Wesley,"This apartment was quite nice and in a comfortable enough neighborhood within walking distance to downtown Albany. Check-in was very straightforward, and as Lloyd tells you in his welcome message, pay attention to the signs for parking and you’ll be fine because it’s pretty widely available nearby. Although if I had been staying there for longer than one night, I could see parking being a little bit of a hassle. That though, I think is a flaw of Albany in general and not a reflection on this unit. Overall I would recommend this unit."

The accessibility to Russell Sage College is less than 5 minutes walking and there are many local bars/restaurants within walking distance as well.  If I find myself visiting Albany again, I will definitely stay here!"

We found the condo to be comfortable, clean, and cozy, and in a nice neighborhood (neighbors wave to one another).  We thoroughly enjoyed our time there, and although we were gone during the daytime most days, the mornings and evenings were quiet and peaceful.  The check-out was at 11 am, which was very nice for us. Would definitely stay here again!"

We rented the space for a big family Thanksgiving dinner and it was just the perfect fit. The host had a very nice welcoming set up that was very appreciated! We felt mostly every need and necessity was met. Suggest possibly having a television in each bedroom. Aside from that small thing, this place is truly a gem!!!"

The apartment is wonderful--historical building but with modern touches. Comfortable, quaint, relaxing. The bed was amazingly comfortable, and the kitchenette provided what I needed for my short stay. If traveling to Albany or the capital region, this is the place to stay!"

Bathroom was well equipped and clean with plenty of hot water and a great shower. <br/>Entry was simple with an easy to remember key code. <br/>Very easy to find the apartment and was just a short 10 dollar Uber from the station. <br/>Lots of good restaurants and bars within walking distance of the place and the Empire State Plaza was just 10 minutes away on foot<br/>Overall a great stay in a fascinating city.

We were in town for a wedding and everything about staying at his place was easy- booking, communication, check-in, check out. Don't be fooled by the unassuming 'cute little place' look, it's HUGE. We had a full house but there was still plenty of space. We spent mornings and evenings out on the deck, two full bathrooms kept us from getting stressed out when it was time to get ready, and nice big comfy furniture in the living room when it was time to relax. Everything we needed was there and accessible- extra blankets, pillows, towels. Lots of extras in the kitchen-bottled water, cereal, coffee, tea. It was a no fuss, super-convenient, and affordable way for our whole family (my husband and I, our 4 adult children and a couple of spouses) to stay together but still have enough space and privacy for all. And it was all SO CLEAN.  Thanks Chris for such a nice stay!"
17545,54126420,-1133642688,2023-10-11,540573801,Raveena,"Host was very communicative and helpful. I had to check out on the second day because of an emergency and they were kind about it. There was no microwave although the listing says there is. The host said he’d drop one off but i decided to try the toaster oven out. The toaster oven works, was dirty but i washed it. There was a dusty/old/cigarette smell but I sprayed the place with air freshener and opened the windows and it was okay. The tenants across the hall and upstairs are very loud at night (until midnight) so it was a bit difficult to fall asleep. They were also loud during the day which is not ideal if you’re working. I only stayed one night and one day so not sure if they are consistently loud. Great, safe location. All in all, I would rebook because the host is reliable and probably spend less time at the abnb."

With that being said, my time with Bela and Laurie was exceptional. They were concerned about my comfort, always available, quick to respond whenever I had questions, and consistently friendly, engaging, and accommodating hosts. The home on South Lake Avenue offers amazing access to Albany City. I spent my time in Albany working for state government and was able to walk to my offices every morning in roughly 20 minutes. If you would prefer, the buses downtown are a 3 minute walk and extremely affordable at $1.30 a ride with a Navigator card. The house is within immediate walking distance of Albany Medical Center, Albany School of Law, Sage College, and the College of St. Rose, so there is plenty of access to amenities.<br/>Bela and Laurie remain extremely conscientious and concerned about the Corona virus, and take great steps to ensure that the house is clean and disinfected, while providing of surplus of materials like hand-sanitizers, disinfectant wipes, and virtually every other cleaning material under the sun, for their guests.<br/>The house itself is beautiful, with a full kitchen, stove/oven, convection oven, microwave, coffee-maker, and other gadgets. The layout is spectacular, with a wonderful sun-porch, dining room, or drawing room - full to the brim with books - to relax in after a long day with a coffee, cocoa, or cocktail. In the basement, there is a coin-operated washing and drying machine. It is not an exaggeration to say that everything you need, and more, is available to you in this home.<br/>I would highly encourage travelers to try Bela and Laurie's charming home. They were fantastic hosts to me, and I think every person deserves the opportunity to be treated so pleasantly and made so comfortable while away from their own homes and families. I would certainly stay again."

Older home with character, but updated.  <br/>Gas fireplace was really cozy and the kitchen especially is very nice.  We enjoyed our short stay.  <br/>Check-in was easy, off-street parking is nice.  Convenient to the event we were attending at the Capital Center. <br/>Angela is a very responsive host, checked in with us to make sure everything was okay with check-in, and after staying overnight.  She answered my questions quickly. <br/> <br/>The place was very clean, but I deducted a star just because the floors seemed to be not that clean (feet were dirty in the shower after walking indoors barefoot).  <br/>And while there were pots and pans and some utensils in the kitchen, I really wish there was at least a coffee pot and maybe a toaster.<br/> <br/>There is a highway and a bus depot across the street.  Wasn't a problem for us, but just be aware.  <br/>Overall good value and nice place for a quick stay.  Thank you!"

We were met with bright tiled floors and the cutest blue leaf table set with dishes for two. The table is small with pull up sides for more seating or cook prep space.  So thoughtful.   The kitchen is fully stocked with quality stainless steel cookware, an amazing full sized high end gas range with top grill gas oven, large microwave hood,  and full stainless  fridge.  Highly functional for any type of cooking.<br/>Just off to the right of the kitchen entrance is the bright open living area with hardwood floors flanked by two of the most inviting bedrooms with the softest bed linen and comfortable matrasses.  We drove 12 hrs and let me tell you we were not disappointed with the deep sleep we were awarded.<br/>There is even an extra office/reading room off the back bedroom that I used to work remotely.  The bedrooms have pocket or folding doors to give privacy.<br/>The living room is perfectly furnished for conversation of watching tv which was stocked with all streaming aps.<br/>The bathroom is tiled with a deep welcoming tub.  Super Super Clean and stocked with towels and shower gels.<br/>When ever we are back here (flying next time) we would hope this spot is available.  It could become our get away home from home!  No Regrets!!!"

Despite our stay being solely for sleeping, the space provided was more than ample for our family.

The outside back deck is very nice and there is a bbq grill there. We did not use this space because we were busy with trips back and forth. Peter is very easy to communicate with! He also dropped off a bag of coffee and tea for us. We hope we can rent Peter’s place for future trips to Albany! He was an excellent host. Thank you, The Ayers Family"

It also comes with anything you could wish for, including a coffee machine, hair dryer and even a TV with Netflix. Phat and Karley were super friendly when we met them and they really have extremely good taste. Just for the beauty of the rooms, the bathroom and the backyard I would have loved to stay for at least a week, just to soak up the beauty of it at all. :) Phat also gave us a ton of local recommendations for restaurants, which were also great. If you are interested in American history, the Schuyler house is also just 5 minutes walking distance from the apartment. I definitely recommend staying with Phat and Karley and hope to be able to return one day!"

It is located right across Lincoln Park as well, which adds a lot to the location. In addition, the place is unbelievably clean and it feels very homey, since James added a lot of touches to make it feel more comfortable for guests. He also included a binder full of information about things to do in Albany, nearby cafes, nearby restaurants, and all the information any guest may want to know about the area. The hospitality was ridiculous! James lives nearby and was very easy to reach. Also, he provided breakfast of New York style bagels, fresh milk, and juice.

The location was in a bad area and the home staged to be cute than it was for comfortability. The restroom was dirty you could not use the toilet comfortably due to the the sink being in front of the toilet. Also no Ac which is the main reason we left in the middle of the night. Being from the city we expected more than a stay to be like this. Also messaged the host stating we were leaving to drive back to the city because of being uncomfortable in the bed and with two fans blowing and still hot. The host never messaged back nor to check in with us. When staying here make sure you have evidence and that you are completely sure because the hosts will deny any form of a refund and pocket your money. The point of air b & b is to enjoy being a local and when renting it out to be hospitable, but these hosts are in it just for money unfortunately."

The bed was very comfortable, the shower had great water pressure and stayed hot, and there’s plenty of amenities to make your stay comfortable (tv, full kitchen, large room). Gregg was also very prompt to respond to questions and flexible. Location is great too. Walkable to government buildings and lots of restaurants/bars."

The location is great, in downtown Albany right next to the College of Saint Rose. Supermarket walking distance as well as a great coffee shop.  Also, plenty of offstreet parking.<br/>Only challenge was there are a lot of stairs in the house. My mom had a little trouble going all the way up to the third-floor bedroom.  But it worked out fine, and based off other reviews we had anticipated she would have to climb stairs.  Just a heads up if you have someone who has mobility issues. <br/>But the house is basically brand new. High quality high-end fixtures and appliances, and very comfortable beds, great place."

She provided a lot of things for us to use making us feel like home. I will definitely be returning to this place when I come back up to Albany. The one concern I have isn’t necessarily about the place or owner, but there are some sketchy people walking around at night near the gas station. Otherwise, great stay!"

These are just some of the things we walked into after traveling for 4.5 hours. Host told us the cleaning crew “must’ve forgotten” this apartment as he has at least eight airbnb rentals in the Capitol Region. Surprised he didn’t think to check the unit, before he allowed new guests to stay. Wish I could include pictures to show you how truly nasty this was."

I checked on an Uber and it should be about $10, well worth it. Jason's neighborhood felt safe within a few block radius with many residential brown stone homes and tree  lined streets. Many, many, small restaurants, a number having vegan selections were scattered within a few blocks.<br/>Jason's place is a ground floor apartment that is clean and neat with a nice kitchen and bathroom. The bed is kingsized and very comfortable. I had a short one night stay and it was pleasant."

My boyfriend and I are normal-sized, 5'8 and 6'0, average weight, and we were very uncomfortable all night - felt like we had no room. Additionally, the quality of the bed was poor so on top of being too small it was also uncomfortable. The place would be absolutely PERFECT if it upgraded to a nice queen bed. Sonya was so lovely, responsive, and kind. If she upgrades the bed and adds that to the description, STAY HERE! I'm sure she will consider this change as she is such a great host!"

The location was very desirable and safe. The apartment itself was comfortable although the renovation job wasn't the best.  For example, the floors are uneven and some boards stick up (watch your toes!), the doors don't latch very well (bathroom in particular), and the back door should really have a deadbolt lock instead of just a knob lock. There was also a lot of dust on the fans and fixtures, so I'd rate the cleanliness as just OK. The hallway outside the unit was filthy with construction dust which forced us to remove shoes in the apartment (thankfully we travel with house shoes). Elizabeth was very nice, but it was clear that English wasn't her first language as some of the instructions didn't make sense. For example, it took me 15 min to locate the unit because the incorrect unit info was given. The address also didn't match exactly. However, I'd still recommend it."

From check-in to check-out, my experience was top notch and I was able to make myself at home with ease. <br/>As a technology guy, I also appreciated the technology touches, like the integration of his Airbnb account with a home automation system for unlocking and locking the doors. <br/>I also love how his place is nestled right down town at a very affordable price.

Its great to see all of the gorgeous brownstones, including the one we stayed in, being renovated and cared for.<br/>In terms of quality, I was pleased by the courtesy of the host's friend who lived nearby. He was there to let us in and make sure I knew to call with any problems. With a full kitchen and two bedrooms, my daughter and I felt at home with plenty of space. As a native of Albany I'm used to thin windows and occasionally noisy neighbors. If you don't sleep well, don't take the master bedroom and be aware that loud music may be playing during the evening and weekend. But there is a fan/ac unit to drown out the din from the street.<br/>This space has been renovated and a vast improvement I'm sure from where it was, and I'm hoping progress will continue here as it seemed a few projects were incomplete. I would have loved to enjoy more sunlight in the house but there was a ton of tree debris in the back yard so there was no way to enjoy opening the windows.<br/>On my own, this place was fine, but if traveling with my child again I will probably pick a quieter location where I'd be able to open windows or put her down for a nap without worrying about excessive noise."

16704,52619545,-1031171054,2023-08-07,118376169,Matt,"I stayed recently with my wife and new baby. While we appreciated the extra space to spread out, I feel like the unit didn't live up to the price tag. It's an older apartment, so the plugs are in weird places and it seems like there was a remodel that was either abandoned or in progress, especially around the bathroom. Other details felt too thrifty, like the ironing board that was meant to be used on a kitchen table that the unit doesn't have, or the DYI headboard in one of the rooms. <br/>The parking on the street is pretty convenient, except for the period when you need to move the car once a week. There didn't seem to be much in the neighborhood, though, so it's really just a place to stay near Albany.<br/>For a little less money per night, we were able to book a hotel in Troy a few nights later and have all of the conveniences we were looking for, minus the living room and extra bedroom. I probably could not recommend this unit to most people based on our experience."

I liked that neighbors were sitting out, walking around, or gathering on their porches. The bed was very comfortable and we slept well. We also made good use of the nice shower. In the morning we buzzed over to the food coop and brought back fixing to make a breakfast feast. I will definitely reach out to stay here again next time I am in town."

I was able to stay with my dog and check out many of the local activities and spots Jake recommended. The apartment itself is in a great location, with the park nearby and light tennis courts with people out and enjoying into the early evening, however, the neighborhood is near some areas of Albany that aren't as safe and people may want to be aware of before walking vs. driving.  This was a comfortable place to stay will all the amenities my pup and I needed and I would certainly consider staying here again if I am in the Albany area in the future."

Best of all, we enjoyed the incredible pizza slices at Sovrana’s, which is a hop skip and a jump away.  Got to check off satisfying my craving for an authentic old-time Little Italy eats experience :)<br/>David was great about checking in, and answering my questions. He provided thorough instructions on how to lock the door, work the bedroom light switch and get a shower running  in a historic building. <br/>Unfortunately I was too jet-lagged at first to figure everything out, but he patiently  answered my questions over the phone.<br/>Thank you, David!"

3685,13083497,635710657,2020-07-07,91720298,Carla,"My two friends and I stayed at this house for a short COVID-escape mini-vacation, largely spending the time staying in the house and cooking our meals. The short of it is that the house was not perfect, but we had an overall pleasant experience. I think our experience in the house deserves a review with the details for future potential guests, so here goes.<br/>First, the good. The house comes with a terrace that is directly in front of what seems to be a wild mass of grass and trees. You can see glimpses of the creek that’s advertised on the post. The view was pleasant, and very green, and hanging out on the terrace reading a book or just enjoying the sun was a nice experience. The kitchen is also relatively well stocked with dishware, utensils, and nonperishable goods like sugar, salt, etc. It’s an eclectic collection, probably thanks more to the guests that have stayed before than to the hosts themselves. The rooms are clean, cute, and spacious, and the bathrooms are similarly unobjectionable; generally, the photos are true to life (with some variations, like cheaper deck/terrace furniture and a cheap but waterproof/protective tablecloth on the dining table). Finally, there are some cute decorations around the house, particularly in the dining room.<br/>Now, the bad. In all, there wasn’t anything that ruined the experience, as these were relatively minor. As I said earlier, we had a pleasant time. But this house did feel unloved and uncared for. The mattresses, for the most part, felt too old and sunken in to be truly comfortable (except for the one in the room immediately to the left of the stairs upstairs--my friend enjoyed the firm mattress on that bed). The kitchen equipment was perfectly adequate, but the pans were beaten up and old, the utensils mismatched and many of them permanently stained, and in general the kitchen just felt unmanaged, a hodge-podge of things people likely had left behind. (On the other hand, we almost always found what we needed for our cooking.) Also, there are stern, wordy, and often repetitive signs throughout the house with dire warnings. The two welcome binders are just full of instructions and rules (speaking of which, expect to see a long laundry list of clean-up tasks you’ll have to agree to just before you book this place -- makes you wonder what exactly the non-negligible cleaning fee is going toward if you’re stripping the beds, wiping down the bathrooms, and taking out the garbage yourself) rather than any clues about local attractions, restaurants, etc. <br/>The biggest disappointment was the lack of access to the stairs and creek behind the house that’s advertised in the AirBnB post. According to a sign, the stairs have been off-access for over a year (June 2019). And sure enough, what little you can see of the stairs are covered by overgrown grass and bushes, and for all we know, the stairs broke off or are falling apart a little bit further down. The sign proclaims that the stairs were not accessible due to circumstances “out of control” of the hosts. My friends and I were disappointed to find that access to the creek/waterfall was falsely advertised (or you had to take the risk yourself and brave the stairs despite the sign, which we didn’t do).<br/>In all, the house is nicely set up, but it didn’t make you feel welcomed.. But if you’re looking for a decent house with the usual amenities that’s located in Albany, it’s an option to consider. Plus, I hope that this review helps the hosts make some improvements to the posting and/or the house, and therefore improve future guests’ experience."

I left in the middle of the night because of screaming and banging upstairs. There were people and a dog running up and down stairs all night. Around 3 am it sounded like fighting broke our upstairs. I walked into the shared bathroom at one point and the floor was soaked and the faucets were running. My rental car was broken into and the neighborhood was sketchy. I learned there had been a shoot out the night  before.

In my time as his guest, I have felt ‘at home’ in every conceivable way. Jon’s house is neat and tidy, with all the modern features one could want. The bedroom, living room, bathroom, and kitchen are all excellent! Jon is undoubtedly the best AirBnB host I’ve ever stayed with. Jon is the definition of a gentleman. I tend to be pretty shy, but Job immediately gave me a very good vibe, making me feel very comfortable. As I’ve gotten to know him over the course of my stay,  I can say that he is one of the most generous, empathetic, and trustworthy people I’ve ever met.

I liked that breakfast was included, that Netflix was set up on the smarttv, and that parking was included (if pre-arranged). I missed real TV, hangers for clothing, and an iron/iron board (I did however not ask for these so Molly might have had it if I had asked). I wish it was a bit cleaner and that the mattress was better. Molly was a great communicator and very flexible around check in/check out, even though I couldn't check in as planned. Super easy to get in with the key being in the lock box. "

The city has struggled, as have so many of America’s, since the decline of industrialization. So it’s nice to see people reviving it and its beauty. <br/>The building has a colorful and tasteful mural of Garfield on its exterior, which sets the tone of the interior’s easy modernity and comfort (common areas, which are dated, aside). <br/>The owner has clearly taken care to provide a comfortable experience. New HVAC, modern bathroom with an excellent shower head, I’d recommend this apartment to anyone. There’s also a shared backyard which was nice to have our dog run around in."

It was close to great restaurants and coffee shops, and a short walk to both the Convention Center and Times Union arena.

Les photos sont représentatives de l’endroit. C’est bien aménagé et propre. La localisation est près de la gare d’autobus et de l’autoroute, il y a ainsi du bruit. Cependant, les chambres étant localisées derrières ça ne nous a pas dérangé pour dormir. Angela est très rapide dans ses réponses et est une hôtesse sympathique. Je recommande sa propriété."

Top!!<br/>Leider kann ich die anderen Bewertungen nicht ganz nachvollziehen. Als ich den Raum betrat blieb mir die Luft weg, da es sehr nach abgestandenen, feuchten Keller gestunken hat. Es gibt einen kleinen Ventilator im Raum, habe mich nicht getraut die Fenster zu öffnen, weil die aussahen als wenn die dann auseinanderfallen. Die Gardinen waren auch nicht ansehnlich. Ich mag gerne alte Möbel aber dort ist ein Sammelsorium an alten Möbeln die wohl nur den Raum füllen sollen, mit fleckigen Polster etc. Man konnte jeden Schritt über einem hören, nicht gerade leise. Was mich leider nur kurz schlafen ließ.<br/>Das Bett ist extrem weich, man liegt total durch, ein Topper soll es besser machen, aber das ist geschmackssache. Das Bad ist im großen und ganzen sauber.<br/>Ich würde weder noch einmal dort übernachten, noch weiterempfehlen. <br/>Das tut mir sehr leid.<br/>Ich gehöre zu den Menschen die nicht viel brauchen aber dort habe ich mich nicht wohl gefühlt."

The space was absolutely gorgeous and you could tell it’s  well taken care of. The bed was so comfy I had to ask him kind it was! I’ll be in touch with him next time I’m in town!"
7046,25549565,-145572276,2022-07-12,148890562,Nowell,"Janet's place is very comfortable, private and well-supplied.  She communicated well with me and made special provision for my late arrival by leaving an outdoor light on.  The neighborhood is charming, historic and quiet.  As she notes in the listing, the exterior door to the space sticks when humidity is high, and it took slamming it to get it to shut.  If you arrive late in the day as I did, you may want to limit your trips back outside until morning so as to avoid the racket.  Other than that small detail, it's a great place to stay.  I needed to leave promptly the next morning or I would have loved to linger in the beautiful urban garden space behind the home."

There was good wifi so we could work from home. We are very familiar with this neighborhood - and can assure others that it is pleasant, safe and friendly. There is easy parking, and the house is on a quiet one-way street less than a 10 min walk from plenty of restaurants, convenience store, wine shop, etc. It's not too far from two bus lines if you need to use them. Diana's place is pet friendly and had a nice washer and dryer. When we arrived the walkways had been thoroughly cleared of snow and ice which was much appreciated. The kitchen is a great space for cooking meals. The living room is comfy and cozy. Thanks also for having nice comfy beds, extra blankets, lots of towels, toiletries, coffee and tea. We definitely recommend Diana's place for a short or long term stay in our area!"

As a queer person. I felt right at home in this affirming neighborhood. It's walkable to Iron Gate, some of the fun local bars, and the capitol! parking is free, and getting into the apartment is a breeze.<br/>Some elments of the space took some adjusting. I recommend some throw pillows for the couch...it's comfy, but you sink in at the back. The space does get a little musty/humid, so just mind the dehumidifier and empty it during your stay. The foot of the bed is very close to the top of the mattress and hurts if you're not careful.<br/>With all of that being said, this place is still 5 stars just for the space, location, and the host alone! When visiting Albany in the future, we will 💯 book with Sean again."

I‎t was walking distance to the park and right by any bars or restaurants on lark. Yet I‎t was still on a street that provided some privacy and escape from I‎t all. I️ made dinner at the air bnb, and Sue was very accommodating. She offered to lend me any extra appliciances I️ may need from her own place that the air bnb did not have and later during my stay she messaged me to check in to be sure I️ still was all set. The shower and sleeping conditions were excellent and very comfy. The only thing is; while the two rooms themselves are big, the place is relatively small. I‎t is also not well lit with natural light if that is a factor in your decision making. I️ would definitely recommend this place to others."

3289,11639446,175585658,2017-07-29,96659049,Alexander,I was here for a ~3 months internship. Location was perfect about a 10 min drive to the touristy part of Albany and 15 min away from work. Work started at 7 am for me and Adam kindly had breakfast waiting at 6 am every morning to start my day. He cleans the house regularly and provides laundry service. There are often new guests coming in so it's a great way to get to know new people and make new friends from all over the world. Can't really beat the price for the location/food/amenities!

This is an impoverished neighborhood and felt very unsafe to walk dogs with my wife or even simply coming and going.  We were cat called in the creepiest way by someone lurking under a stoop, violent yelling up and down the street, and what appeared to be drug deals.  The description of ""street noise"" is misleading as this is a terrible neighborhood.<br/>On the plus side, the interior of the place was fairly presentable for the age of the structure."

Dog friendly with a park across the street and a back yard to boot. Got some pizza from SoHo’s which was well worth it. Settled right in and kicked on netflix. Good hot water/pressure. Good heat! We slept well on a comfortable bed. Can’t ask for more: but then it even has a sauna. Due to time constraints we didn’t get to try it but to have as an option is great! Thanks for a wonderful stay.

It should be noted that the neighborhood is dealing with issues of systemic racism and poverty. The area is close to the capital, walking distance for those who love to tool around by foot. I think the communications were all automated. I asked early the night before check out what would be needed to check out and we didn’t hear back until morning.  All good, but that info could be included in description. Grateful for our peaceful stay!"

13555,45528939,-1436238905,2021-06-20,68946620,Jeffrey,"Main problem is parking. While there is a parking lot behind the building which looks like it would be dedicated parking for the unit, it is not. There is no dedicated parking. Only street parking. our host suggested the parking garage next door. But, the garage is only parking by permit only and has no parking attendant or door place to pay for parking. There is a large lot nearby, but same situation, no lot attendant  or place to pay for parking. And I was not comfortable leaving my car parked on the street as I was afraid my car would get broken into. The place itselfis nice<br/> A downstairs kitchen and small sofa. No TV downstairs though. The only TV is in the bedroom. The bedroom is compact, but again nicely decorated. I have a bad back, and unfortunately found the bed uncomfortable. But it might be fine for others. The bathroom was very nice. It is very near the state government buildings. But the unit itself did not seem to be in a great area. I would say it would be a great place for someone coming into Albany to work for a couple days at the government complex and is taking an Uber back and forth. But for our purposes on a vacation hiking in the area and having our own car, it did not suit our purposes."

It was so fun to have the pool table accessible right in the living room (although a lot of the cues are a bit broken). We really appreciated that the kitchen is super well-stocked with spices and also a giant blender. The tub is great because it’s so huge, but we couldn’t get the jets to work (maybe that was on us) or the hot water to fill up all the way - but still great for a soak! My boyfriend and I stayed for 6 days and had a great time."

Full kitchen, spacious, modern decor. Could use upholstery deep cleaning of the sofa and dinning room chairs. AC is listed on amenities but does not exist in the unit. Recommend a deep cleaning of the entire floor as well. Because of the responsiveness of Queen to resolve our concerns and make a fair adjusment to our rate we would consider staying again if we were in the area."

7841,28722270,422652092,2019-03-11,88738049,Mary,"I was traveling for work in the capital district and was looking for a unique spot to stay for the evening. Earl’s attic loft was the perfect find! Check-in was very easy thanks to the detailed instructions that came way in advance, and attention to detail did not go unnoticed. Earl keeps the loft stocked with breakfast snacks and beverages for anyone who is looking for a quick bite, but the neighborhood also offers plenty of options for meals within a short walk. I thought the personal note welcoming me on check-in and candy dish was a nice touch, and the loft was clean and smelled wonderful on arrival. Parking was fairly easy - I opted for street parking because you don’t need to pay the meters on weekends. The space itself was quiet and comfortable, perfect for a peaceful night of work before heading out the next day. Though the bus station is across the street and the interstate is nearby, I didn’t hear any of it. I will definitely look to stay here again in the future if traveling to Albany."

We should know because we stayed for the entire month of July 2020. She gets 5 stars across the board.  If you need anything, do not hesitate to text her, and she will get it to you no later than the next day.  Also, free parking is an extraordinary bonus in this area of Albany, NY."

They are super responsive which is helpful. The place is spacious and well lit. My biggest concern was that the temperature never made it over 68 degrees inside the house. This would be fine in the summer but it was Mid February and the weather was frigid. Despite getting instructions and trying different things recommended by the host, I gave up trying. No matter what I did each day and night the heat remained around 68. The floors were naturally cold and I intentionally left my house slippers home because I didnt think I would need them. So walking on the cold floor daily was a sad reminder. Even though the host was responsive, it was frustrating to have to call consistently about the same concern so I stopped reaching out. They were really nice and apologized for the inconvenience and invited me back. I would give it another try, as long as the heat is fixed 🥶."

Don’t even get me started on the water pressure and adorable patio!
5631,22431640,413422866,2019-02-17,243375679,Wade,Highly recommend this place to stay if you have business in Albany. Located downtown and it’s right next to everything!

19242,1300873558,736121862,2023-07-21,488222901,Laura,"Sean's apartment is adorable. It looks just like the photos. It was immaculate and with both an AC unit and a really effective dehumidifier, it was very comfortable climate-wise. The apartment was also surprisingly quiet, considering that it is a garden-level (mostly below ground) unit with shared walls on both sides and an inhabited floor above. So, if you are looking for a quiet place to rewind at the end of the day, or to do some work in the evening, this is a good spot. Sean was remarkably easy to reach and delightful to deal with. As others before me have noted, the unit has been tastefully redone recently and has a marvelous walk-in shower. The kitchen is also very well done. Only one slightly not positive thing (I liked this place so much that I didn't want to use the word ""negative""): the unit is not large.  But I will gladly hope it will be available the next time I need to overnight in Albany. This one, of the three AirBnBs I've used in Albany, is far-and-away the best."

The check in process is a little complicated- I had to download an app and the passcode kept changing but it feels safe. The walls are definitely thin so you can hear everything that is going on with the neighbors and outside. However, Earl is friendly, accommodating and quick to respond."

1683,9005989,229026561,2018-01-21,167331662,Jhanae,If you want something that is accessible and has modern yet classic qualities then Josh and Sue's place will make a great fit for you. The photos posted are indeed as advertised and the place came with the perfect amount of amenities (body wash and shampoo goals). My only complaint is the faint basement smell and the fairly cold rooms and shower. Overall I was pleased with our stay.

It's super clean and he's super fast to respond to messages and the apartment is right in the middle of everything.  Unfortunately I had a couple of clompers who put shoes on and clomped around above me for 90 minutes starting just before 6 am.  Even pulling furniture through the place, but it was time to get up anyway.  Would be happy to stay here a third time when I'm next in town."

334,3820211,48508593,2015-09-27,8701852,Cherry,"I went to Albany to do research at the New York State Library & Archives. Terra's place was in the perfect location to do that, a short and easy walk away. It was wonderfully spacious, brightly lit and had everything I needed for my short stay. Texts with Terra helped me figure out the few questions I had: where to find light switches and a grocery story. I was very comfortable there, and comfortable with the neighborhood, realizing a little too late that there were areas right around the corner on Lark Street that would have been very fun to explore.<br/>My very first impressions were a bit tainted by the fact that I arrived late, after dark, and wasn't familiar with the city, making the location difficult to find: the street is small and busy (at that moment at least, including emergency vehicles amassed just down the street), and it was difficult to read the house numbers while driving. That meant I had to drive around, negotiating unusually unforgiving one way streets, before I figured out 1) where the building was and 2) where to park. <br/>Once there, the din in the neighborhood was impressive! Criminy, this is only Thursday, I thought. It turns out, though, that Thursday night is Karaoke night at the bar just on the other side of the bedroom window. Happily, Friday and Saturday nights were oasis(s?) of peace by comparison.<br/>Overall, I enjoyed my stay and felt happily at home, and would go back. "

We stayed a couple nights and had good WiFi connections and tables/desk to work from  while there.  Kitchen had good amenities to make any meal you want.

We were in town for a show at The Egg and everything was walking distance or a quick ride away - if you’re here on the weekend, street parking is plentiful, and if you leave your car there during meter hours, you can pre-pay using the Park Albany app! Dillon was very responsive and helpful, and I would not hesitate to stay here again!"
4585,19527043,-1379951213,2021-06-28,5529842,Mason,"I cannot say enough good things about our stay here. The house is ginormous and absolutely beautiful. Our room had it's own AC that worked perfectly, the hosts are home but have completely separate living quarters that you never even see.....even if your a wanderer like me. One of the most clean and comfortable stays I've had in a very very long time. The Pictures just don't do this place justice. Ed and his wife made us feel like we were just visiting family.<br/>If you haven't stayed in a room instead of a whole place before, this is experice to assure you that rooms on air bnb are fantasic. <br/>I'd rent the room long term and live in the house if I lived in town. <br/>Thank you for being such fantastic people!"

The only problem I can think of is that you can hear neighbors play loud music so if you are looking for a super quiet place this is not for you.

More than that, Greg is a relaxed, kind guy and the large, cozy room is full of neat historical furniture and items.  You feel like you are in a different time.  Some of the old doors and windows need a little patience but everything works great and you have all you need including a modern TV and mini fridge if you desire.  There is free street parking.  Just give Greg your plate information beforehand.  Thanks for a special time Greg.  God bless your family.  Wish I could have stayed longer.  "

3780,14316232,294177365,2018-07-21,171044613,Edward,This was a great place. It was inexpensive but walking distance to the medical center and restaurants. The host responded quickly to questions and the room was very clean. My only complaint is that it is 4 rooms for 3 different guests but only 1 bathroom. A couple mornings I had to wait a bit to get ready for the day. 
15347,50211226,1919090798,2022-10-16,410525849,Vivian,I came up here for an event in Rhinebeck and we really enjoyed our stay. It had every little thing you could think of. Plus lots of extra linens and a fan which we were very thankful for. The hosts were very kind and hospitable as well!
5760,22431640,624528634,2020-05-11,114187605,Jeremy,Jake was extremely attentive on answering any questions I had as well as his written out guide of the area and of the Airbnb. The sauna is unbelievable I hopped in every morning before my shower and my day was kickstarted. Kitchen was beautiful I wish I had more time to cook but we were in and out the whole weekend. Would totally stay again if I needed somewhere local to stay!

21158,1126075983,-1919264142,2023-05-13,25172938,Desiree,Phat and Karley were wonderful and friendly hosts. The space was beautiful and had everything we needed for our brief stay. Phat was quick to provide us with local restaurant recommendations and helpful in offering us to use their iron/steamer when we didn’t have one. Street parking was easy and the place is walking distance to the downtown area (about 15-20 min walk). Would definitely recommend their home for anyone visiting the area.
1544,9005989,100301854,2016-09-08,29681184,John,Sue was great! Extremely responsive and helped answer all of our questions. Upon arriving we were able to immediately enter the studio and drop off our things. We went on to do business in Albany and Troy and then returned to the studio for a good nights rest.

She had nice little touches (eg, microwave, kettle, fridge) in the room.  We got several inches of snow, and she had a broom outside for wiping my rental car off.  So helpful!"

The backyard was also incredibly peaceful and the beds were very comfy! I’d fall asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow every time. Everything was very clean and everything about this stay was exceptional! Thanks again for the amazing hospitality!

9771,33558235,543318481,2019-10-07,261594428,Dominique,"This place was incredible and even better than shows. Everything is about a 15 minute walk. It's a very safe building, not to mention super clean! They left a little note on the table saying welcome which was a nice and appreciated little touch. The communication was probably the better than i could've asked for. We ended up forgetting to pack a few essentials and they had everything there. Will definitely stay here in the future. Thanks again!"
6175,24655782,322589839,2018-09-13,19648922,Christina,"Simple, clean, comfortable space.  Walking distance to several great restaurants.  Private and easy check-in/out.  Great find!"

The location was prime - on a beautiful and quiet sun soaked street and near all of the things we wanted to see. The unit itself was stunning and well stocked with all essential items. The cleanliness was immaculate as well.  The beds were SO comfortable, the shower has great water pressure, and the kitchen was a wonderful perk. We had a great movie night with the TV! <br/>Lloyd accommodated all of our needs and was very kind. Communication was excellent. If we ever come back to this area, we know where we will be staying :)"
2471,9501054,-79456744,2023-12-03,538231413,David,Was in town for a couple nights to watch Siena and Albany basketball. Would stay there again.

11370,39836487,-172994602,2023-04-23,38787728,Peter,We had a very pleasant experience with our 2 night stay to see a performance at The Egg.  The show was a 20 minute walk from the place and less than $10 to Uber back in the evening. Because it was the weekend we were lucky enough to be able to park right in front both nights.    It’s an older building with no elevator and the stairs might be a challenge to some but check-in was a breeze. The place was clean and cozy with a nice tub/shower and a comfortable bed.  As some people have noted the place is fairly no-frills so check with the host beforehand if you’re not sure about the amenities but the price was right as well as the location and we would definitely stay here again.
5587,22431640,334182024,2018-10-08,73217615,Mary,"Great little apartment, super cute and clean. Loved the little welcome note and cookies laid out for our arrival too - such a nice touch !"

5219,21392315,-1364004939,2023-12-22,44508353,Lida,The place was as described in the photo. It had a private entrance and easy access. Everything was clean and spotless. Even though I spent a lot of time with my grandson it was nice to be able to come to my own place and sleep in a comfortable bed instead of on an air mattress {I know I did it the last two times when I visited). It was nice and quiet and I could watch whatever I wanted on TV. Home away from home.
17504,54126420,-1782978526,2022-09-10,141204399,Dawn,"The area was very quiet and close to some major areas of interest. It was exactly as described and it was easy to check in and out. parking right on the street in front of the house is big plus. The apartment was clean and furnished nicely. There were essentials in the kitchen if you needed to cook and towels provided in the bathroom. The matress was a great concern for me, I have a bad back, and  I always have issues  when we travel. it was great, possibly new, but I wasn't tossing about in pain all night and woke up without back problems. Thats huge. We were only there a short time but it served as a nice clean spot to stay and we will try to book again when in the area. I can recommend this place."
21084,1713784628,1143640845,2023-09-04,89783700,Riaz,Elizabeth was very responsive to our needs when anything was missing. Instacarted us anything that was missing. Great location in a safe area close to lots of restaurants and parks. Walkable neighborhood. <br/>The bathroom just needs an upgrade. It wasn’t in the listing pictures so I wasn’t aware. <br/>I wasn’t sure if there was a heating system. Maybe I missed it.

Parking can be difficult since it's first come first serve so you may not be guaranteed to park in front of the apartment."

11698,39873571,-1145013547,2022-09-22,189239961,Audra,"Great stay. Centrally located, close to the Capital, the Park. Had some great free pizza downstairs courtesy of Adem. Adem was helpful and great with communication. FYI, there are some steep steps leading to the apartment if you have any mobility issues and parking can be a bit tricky. Make sure to pay attention to the parking signs. Had no problem finding a space just had to circle around a bit. Would definitely stay again."

7197,25549565,727995685,2023-09-13,203958235,Lori,We loved the neighbourhood and the location of Janet’s Airbnb! Would recommend it to anyone that has never been to Albani. Was warm at night but the window AC unit fixed that right away.

He relieved all my worries about how to travel to the right exam place on time and how to feed myself, so I could focus on my studies. I enjoy talking to him and I love every meal and dessert he made. I will come back again!"

It's not pristine, but I wouldn't say it's dirtier than a typical multi-bedroom apartment in an older building. It didn't smell or otherwise seem unhygienic. Location was not a fancy neighborhood but was very convenient to public transportation. The place has a laid-back vibe, and my room was very quiet and comfortable. I found it a very relaxing place to stay."

We were able to easily walk not only to the Palace, but to the commercial area of Albany's North Pearl Street area (restaurants, etc.). Parking on street was not a problem at all. The space itself is exactly as advertised. Very cool ceilings! Comfortable."

I contacted the owner and was told to go to the shared basement. The basement made me feel frightened and only had a pile of dirty sheets. The linen that was provided (a duvet) was stained. The floor was not vacuumed and I’m fairly certain the towels provided (2) were left from previous guests. Communication was good until there was a problem and I have since been ignored. I have requested a portion of our stay be refunded and have been ignored. It was the longest night of my life in this apartment and has turned me off Airbnb all together."
5605,22431640,348617156,2018-11-14,61647786,Cory,Exactly what we needed. We were in town for one night and needed a simple place to stay. It was easy to find and get into. Check in and check out was hassle free. The apartment was nice and warm when we walked in and it met all of our expectations.

Quiet neighborhood. <br/>Earl is super responsive to any questions/ issues you or your guest(s) might have.<br/>Cons: The sofa is old and a bit uncomfortable to sit. The bed in the first bedroom squeaks. The blinds and a few things that are either broken or not working. <br/>Overall, our stay was great. There’s also a playground for anyone who’s traveling with kids."

Lloyd provided all the information we needed for check in ahead of time, unprompted, which is always important to me. When a question came up during our visit, Lloyd replied within the hour. I really liked Lloyd's laminated cards in the apartment with tips and reminders; it was handy to not have to hunt for certain information. All in all, great AirBNB experience and no complaints at all. Thanks Lloyd!"

There were several wide spaced steps to enter the unit. Rails on both sides and plenty of room. I have limited mobility after my brain surgery yet had no problem on the steps. <br/>I was in town for a conference and David even made his unit available to me two hours before my check-in time.<br/>I greatly appreciate the solitude I enjoyed during my stay. Although I was easily able to reach David if needed, I did not require any assistance. <br/>The space is delightful, offering ample room for a single occupant, and several more could comfortably have stayed. I highly recommend booking with David for a stress-free travel experience and a serene environment to simply be oneself, all while adhering to the established guidelines."

The game room was an added bonus, enjoyed by kids and adults alike.<br/>It is located  within walking distance of one of the most highly rated brunch places in Albany  as well as several  other restaurants. It's also within walking distance of a grocery  store, dunkin donuts, and even an electric  car charging station. It's an easy drive to downtown and the Lark St area.<br/>The host is friendly, welcoming and easy to contact.

I walked to and from the hospital in 7 minutes, you can walk to all of the best restaurants and bars Albany has to offer, and the spot was so quiet and felt so safe. The actual air bnb is SO nice and comfortable too, the exposed brick and layout/furniture is gorgeous. I would 10/10 recommend this apartment for anyone, either a short or long term stay. Thank you guys for the great experience!!!"

There was plenty of space to park right in front of the house. <br/>The apartment itself is spacious; large living room and kitchen. There are some plates, cups and other items for use in the kitchen as well as coffee and tea. The bedroom and bathroom are cozy. Bedroom has a comfortable mattress and pillows. Shower is good. Only thing I recommended Jake is to change the color of the lights in the living room and kitchen. That way the whole apartment will feel cozy!<br/>Oh and Jake responds very quickly in case you have questions. Would stay at Jakes place again if the future brings me to Albany. Lot of value for money!"

It served its purpose: it is clean, has comfortable beds and has all of the necessities.  I recommend downloading the August Home app for entry into the apartment, as the door codes didn't work the night that we arrived (another couple staying in the same building had the same issue)."

21911,1426982732,-1093748218,2023-12-03,115931477,Trina,"This place was large and had a lot of space. We could not sit at the dining room table because the screws on each of the seats were coming out and poked us -there was no padding on the chairs.  The bathroom was clean and updated. The kitchen was clean.  In the bedrooms, the mini blinds did not go all the way down and cover the window and some of the blinds were broken so there was not complete privacy at night.  It’s on the second floor in a very old building, and the stairs were steep and unstable.  It was a good location as far as being close by other places in the city -the parking was not as described. We had to park on the street."

14263,47345872,-913210615,2023-03-19,157573034,Hirah,"Highly recommend. Great place to stay for a few days. Walking distance from many restaurants, Market 32 grocery store is two blocks away, Uber and ride share accessible, and the loft itself is gorgeous and clean! Private parking was reliable. There are multiple private entrances but none are wheelchair accessible or accessible to people who have difficulty with stairs. I lived in Albany for 9 years and then moved back to NYC. So I am familiar with the neighborhood. Some might find it noisy at night. The loft is very well done and really nice for the location honestly. The building is an old police station and quite cool and historic. All amenities worked well and were clean. Most necessary kitchen tools were provided but nothing above and beyond. TVs were comically smaller than the spaces in which they were placed. So minor things there."
7185,25549565,802422337,2023-08-01,501724007,George,"Room is exactly as pictured. Located right in the middle of downtown area, with tons of walkable restaurants and cafes. Perfect spot to stay a few days in Albany!"
19004,-138713049,2009809240,2023-04-16,9636658,Scott,"The unit was near the event we were going to see on at the Hollow, very accessible from Interstate. The unit looked as pictured.That it was an aged building which was not apparent in the photos. Although the stairs were very squeaky the unit was very quiet<br/>The hood although very tidy, seemed a little on the sketchy side and we felt somewhat uncomfortable walking back there after the show at 1am.  Although it was without incident. The only washroom access is through one of the bedrooms which detracted from it privacy if folks in the other bedroom need to use the washroom.<br/>At first we had a hard time locating the keypad to get in. It is very well camouflaged in the door handle and does light up until you begin to use it. The lower door near the street number was simply a padlocked door. We ended up figuring this out, but had an unsettling few minutes going back and forth double checking address and door multiple times before we figured it out. The mechanism worked well afterwards."

8342,28722270,816043047,2022-10-02,18494838,Brian,We stayed in the loft for 1 night. Had what we needed and getting in was an easy process. Communication is great and there was no delay with responses to questions. Location is perfect. Literally walk around the corner and are at the MVP Arena. I think that is the name now at least. Walk a little further past that and you are in the main downtown area. Parking spot in back was a nice feature as well so you don’t need to worry about street parking being available. As far as I know you have to walk around to to front to get in the building but the back parking is close enough that it doesn’t matter. Felt save in and out of the apartment. Apartment is cozy and has the essentials. We weren’t in need of much so can’t comment beyond that it worked for us. Overall a good experience and perfect spot for exploring Albany.

It is a roomy apartment with a seating area, a TV on the wall, a kitchenette, a beautiful bedroom, and a great bathroom. I came here for a rowing race on the Hudson River, which didn’t give me a whole lot of time to enjoy Linda’s place. The location is excellent! For me it was close enough to the Hudson River to be able to walk there. It is also on walking distance to a number of good restaurants and pubs in downtown Albany. I wish I had more time! I will remember this for another trip."

There is a beautiful dining room able to accommodate 8+ people.   The kitchen is well lit and well equipped.   Having a full size washer and dryer is a plus.   There is a large, very private deck which overlooks a wooded area which makes it seem you are miles away from the city.   The location offers privacy, serenity and yet convenience to all that Albany has to offer."

Most of Albany is open very limited hours right now which got very frustrating but because the apartment has such a central location it was easy to hop back and forth, and since it’s a good size not being able to go out as much wasn’t too bad, we made use of the foosball table.

All the amenities were so awesome (especially the pool table) and the space was huge and bright.<br/>It was very easily accessible and everything was ready and available when we arrived. It felt like a dream home away from home.<br/>My friends and I had a great time hanging out and playing pool and catching up. It rained the whole time we were in Albany and having this place really made our trip. If we had stayed anywhere else we would have had such a worse time in all the wet but Diana’s place was such a nice and comfortable respite from the rain with plenty to do in your very own space.<br/>Diana was also very accommodating in that she responded almost immediately to any question we had. She was so attentive to our needs I would hire her to replace Siri if I could.<br/>This is the ideal place to stay if you are planning a trip to Albany. I don’t know where else you can find such a high quality stay for the price (especially for 6 Adults). If you have any second thoughts, dispel them now; this place is the best."

Place was clean and had everything we needed.   Only minor snafu was we never got a parking pass even after being told it would be coming, but fortunately our car wasn't towed.   Would definitely stay here again if up in the area."

The bed was super comfortable and I slept great. One thing to note is that you’ll cross the other room to go to the bathroom, which was not an issue for me. Alice is really caring and makes sure to get out of your way if wanted or is up for a chat, if wanted. She even prepared coffee in the morning, which I found super nice. Overall, refer to locals about which areas are safe. Alice can give you recommendations for example."

It's a basic and simple studio, it's clean, the bed is super comfy, it has a large desk which is great for studying and the location is good! The kitchen is well equipped too. There is a deli/ small superette with the basics right in front of the house. The best thing is that Chas is really responsive and helpful and easy to communicate with. I spent the day revising in the main room of the studio where the desk is and the downside is that It gets quite cold. I think in spring or summer-time itd be perfect! The studio is downstairs and it's the coldest part of the house although it was warm upstairs in the kitchen, bathroom, living room...etc... It's true that I come from a warm place and am not used to Albany's cold temperatures in winter!! I told Chad about it and he brought me a small electric stove I could use in addition to the one there was in the bedroom. It was much better !! If you leave the electric heater in the bedroom on all day or during the night it's very strong, works well and it gets pretty warm. Hope it helps! Thanks Chad!!!"

We were extremely and positively happy to see 2 main bedrooms on the main floor so that the elders did not have to climb up and down the stairs.  Craig was responsive to our questions and.  The reason we go to an Airbnb instead of the hotel is the fact that we don't want to always have to go to restaurants.  Craig has plenty of dishes, eating utensils, pots, pans, cutlery so that we can cook for our family of 8.  It was a wonderful stay for us."

The area was quit with all the ammenities we need. Earl was an exceptional host: he checked in throughout our stay to make sure we didn't have any further needs. He was empathetic and understanding to me leaving a little late after I left my phone at a restaurant. I would definitely recommend this downtown gem.

He was a considerate and proactive host, reaching out about parking and check-in. The space was beautiful and immaculate. The history major in me loved the historic touches that were kept in the space while the lover of whimsy adored the artwork and small touches! The bed was comfortable, the couch was more comfortable than the bed, games, and cards to pass the time during the rainy weather we've been having. Lovely grounds and close to the things that brought us to the area!<br/>We will definitely stay here again!"

There was some stains on the furniture but overall acceptable. The host was very responsible and replied to message quickly. We stayed on the second floor, and on our last day someone moved in to the first floor and they were having parties all night…I contacted the host and she took immediate action, and those guest became quiet for about an hour but then resumed their party. It was about 1am, and the party continued until around 5am in the morning. We didn’t sleep well and the host was nice enough to allow us check out late."

I booked this stay last minute and didn’t have any expectations, but it ended up being one of the most beautiful luxurious places I’ve ever stayed. Upscale yet relaxed. Spacious yet cozy. This place hits every mark. I stayed in the sun and silk room which features ample seating (including a leather couch) a fire place, and an extremely comfortable bed with amazing pillows. Bonus points for snuggly friendly pups. Can’t wait to stay here again. I’ll never stay anywhere else in Albany now that I’ve discovered this gem."

14802,48124042,-416287060,2022-07-06,384076085,Jessica,"Our stay with Dillon was seamless! The central location in downtown was perfect for local eateries (cobblestone, Emmanuel’s Thai and Cider Belly’s were our favorites!), as well as walking distance to the Capitol area for the fireworks show - as our stay was over 4th of July. Parking is just as described- I don’t recommend parking parallel to the apartments around the corner (not Dillons bldg), park next to the park or in the garage. We think we will be in Albany next year and we will be staying in the same place for sure!"

The hosts are awesome and super easy to communicate with. It is definitely our preferred Airbnb when visiting family in Albany.<br/>For people visiting Albany for the first time Jake & Kate have super helpful tips too! A few restaurant choices even I wasn’t aware of (being that I’m from Albany originally) that were great to visit. Definitely a great place to stay and will look to stay again in the future!"

16795,52836323,1938715182,2022-09-25,3523455,Valerie,Diana was an amazing and communicative host and the apartment was comfortable and clean. We needed to find a place that would accommodate our little dog when we visited our daughter at U Albany for family weekend (because the truth is she pretty much missed the dog the most) and Diana’s apartment was perfect. The neighborhood was safe and very sweet (an old time suburban area) that was a straight shot 5 minute drive to campus. Highly recommend!

There are great local bars and restaurants on the adjacent blocks, and it's right up the hill from the free NY State Museum and very cool Empire Plaza. Washington park is also right there, perfect for us and our pups to stretch our legs. The space was clean, easy to access, full of amenities (including a hosts wine selection for purchase!) and communication was fast and easy. There is a reason this place stays booked. As a frequent AirBNB'er I highly recommend this spot!"

Great use of the space, too.  I liked all the details, like the lamp on the nightstand and extra charging cables. There was some street noise, but it didn't bother us at all, not a super busy or loud street. The location is excellent! Right across the street from the park and within walking distance to many restaurants and shops. It was also a short drive to downtown and the capital. The building itself was also very cool!

10305,34330970,858227698,2023-01-02,243907390,Stacy R,The loft was very cute inside. Pool table was a plus. Location is near things in walking distance but I would not feel comfortable in the area walking alone. This property was listed as a 2 bedroom when it’s really a one bedroom and there is a second bed behind a room divider.. so this is fine if you are ok without privacy… couch was extremely comfortable

It was very clean especially the bathroom. If you like cooking for yourself, there is a great kitchen setup. <br/>The neighbor was pretty nice. There is a pizza shop across the street, a Dunkin’ Doughnuts, as well as gas station. At no point did we feel unsafe. <br/>We would be happy to book with them again when we come back to Albany."

9928,33558235,-471277174,2021-07-02,287515014,Malcolm,This is nice spot.  1815 historic house that has been gently renovated.  Comfy beds and clean kitchen and bathroom.  Good supply of basic gear in kitchen which is handy. Very handy from the highway and Port of Albany.  A bit of a hike up to the Plaza and Lark St etc. Nearest supermarket is across the river or a 10min jaunt away.  Even though it is right by the interchange it doesn't seem noisy (to a city person).  AC in every room kept it fine  a heat wave.  I have stayed here in winter and the heat was adequate too.  Definitely will check if available when working in Albany again.

19386,1222946856,1621225520,2023-01-08,189914,Dan,"I returned once again and this time stayed in one of the larger rooms. It is amazing, much more comfortable and much more luxurious than many  inns or B&Bs that you could book for double or triple the price. Spend some time in front of the gas fireplace, there are many… On a gigantic floor pillow that is like a dream. <br/>Of course you have to make your own breakfast, but it is a pleasure in the magnificent gourmet chef- quality kitchen. You can cook any meals you want there also!<br/>Everything in this house is high end and super clean and very elegant, from the bedrooms to all the common areas.<br/>Thomas is a great host, available if you need anything but also the house allows a lot of privacy when you want it.<br/>One of the best shared Airbnb’s you will  ever find."

From the backyard fire pit, the great wifi, the laundry in the basement, the full kitchen, grill, and even a keyboard, we were thrilled. Came to town to get out of NYC for awhile and we felt at home here. Perfectly located close to stores, restaurants, malls, the highway, midway between downtown Albany and uptown and then very convenient to easily get to Saratoga, the Catskills, Adirondacks, Berkshires, it really was perfect. We came in to a very clean place with towels, sheets, and everything you need for a 5 week (or 2 day) stay. Beds and living room couch are super comfortable, and Rosanne was an awesome host, answering the very few questions we had immediately. Highly recommend her home for any length stay and look forward to returning."

First, the location is ideal for my plans, literally just a block and a half from the venue I was attending, not to mention that it's a lovely neighborhood in general filled with fantastic shops and restaurants. <br/>The space itself is extremely clean, bright, well staged, and very comfortable. Jason's communication was superb from start to finish, even going as far as to warn me ahead of time about a sudden street blockage situation due to some studio filming. For everything I got out of it, the price was phenomenal; I would recommend this property without hesitation, and I hope to be fortunate enough to be able to rent it again in the future."

This was right in the heart of Albany close to Washington Park and all the shops and restaurants on Lark. Sue was very responsive with messages and her place was so cute and clean! She has a Roku tv so you can watch Netflix and whatever else and a full kitchen if you want to cook. The bed is comfy and the whole place was very updated and nice.

9701,32993402,-1725918000,2023-06-29,21480746,L,"The worst part of the stay was when us three women over 60 were catching up with each other and 2 strange men walked into our rental. I yelled at them and they left immediately, seeming to be genuinely surprised. We did not have a language in common, so they couldn't explain themselves. I freaked out at landlord on the phone, wanting an explanation. He called me a Karen and said he wanted us 3 to leave, that HE didn't feel safe, that I was scamming HIM. For the cost of one night's stay split 3 ways? Yeah, no. I have a solid history with Airbnb. No trouble ever. I eventually found out the explanation for the intruders; it was sloppy last minute booking communication over a different apartment in the building. I did not appreciate the landlord immediately blaming us. I do not respond well to blame-the-victim."

We stayed in the attic and I only wish we'd been staying longer than our 1 night so we could really enjoy the space.  Very convenient to local shops and restaurants, and easy access to the highway.  We didn't get to meet Thomas but he was very quick to respond to me with a couple of questions I had.  Absolutely recommend if you're stopping in Albany."

His description of the place is spot on. It's not the best neighborhood but it doesn't feel like it's dangerous, it's just not super affluent so the houses aren't nice and pretty, which is fine. The place is clean enough but it's not sparkly like a hotel. Also, fine by me. Overall, though, the value is incredible.<br/>About those breakfasts. The first day, for example, there was a peanut butter sandwich and some other kind of sandwich, maybe egg? Not totally sure. He also will make coffee for you if you ask."

Clean, refurbished and attractive space - we were there for a funeral and thought we needed extra sleeping arrangments (of which there was plenty!)  and also a kitchen - which was roomy, attractive and well-appointed. We  really got 'alot' for the price. Scott was super responsive to every message, and even accepted a few minor suggestions. Oh, and the small balcony off the living room was just right (with tall, cushioned chairs) for relaxing, breathing and taking in the night sounds after a long, emotional day.  Recommend!!"

16442,52360097,2123516745,2022-06-20,176135716,Jill,"Overall, we had a lovely stay. <br/>A few things to add to what previous guests shared (All of which we found to be true, so no reason to repeat)<br/>The building is old and it creaks and sometimes you can hear the elevator. If you are a light sleeper, earplugs might be appreciated. <br/>Apartment is full of natural light which is awesome! Unless you are trying to sleep past sunrise. I wish I had remembered my sleep mask.<br/>The bed was reasonably comfortable, but very conducive to cuddling."

14779,48124042,-192636182,2022-03-07,140950501,Samuel,"This is a great little apartment in a fantastic spot. We were down in Albany for a concert at Empire Underground and this place is right down the street. Lots of places nearby and there’s a detailed map with locations marked hanging on the wall, which was helpful. My only (mild) complaint is that the cleaning fee is about $30 more than anywhere else."
7443,28341274,43791188,2021-08-06,20954182,Sandie,A 5 star plus stay! Alice's abode is located in the much sought-after Washington Park. The building has the antiquitous charm and high ceilings expected in these old brownstones. The room faces the park and is in walking distance to Lark street with plenty of stores and local cuisine.<br/>    Alice's home is exceptionally clean and well-decorated; a relaxing feel and beautiful artwork that soothes the overworked soul. Alice was such a joy to spend time with and extremely considerate and thoughtful. My highest recommendations go with Alice and her exquisite abode.
3260,11639446,80224029,2016-06-17,68287769,Xavier,"I was up in Albany for business and only needed the room to sleep and clean off. Adam was a great host. The meals included in the price of the room was simple but tasty and healthy. The house is quiet and basic, the room has a key lock. You can park in the rear of the house. The neighborhood seemed quiet during the time I was there and I felt safe enough to run to the federal plaza in the morning. Overall this was a good experience, first AirBnB stay but probably not the last."

8341,28722270,347732701,2022-09-19,25426966,Yohann,Appartement charmant et bien équipé. Il manque juste un canapé convertible avec un bon matelas quand il y a 2 couples qui occupent le logement. Le reste est top 👍
17917,1338278605,-328433268,2022-03-02,210773686,Kevin,Clyde's place is in an excellent location and is incredibly charming if you're a fan of 19th century architecture. Clyde himself is a responsive and laid-back host who keeps an immaculately clean residence. I had a very positive experience in my stay with Clyde.

5859,22431640,1808219894,2022-02-19,80138882,Shannon,"If you stay here you won’t be disappointed!<br/>I’m on a OR nursing travel assignment in Albany and Jake’s place was perfect for an extended stay. The location is super close to the hospital (walked there daily) and the apartment was spacious and really clean. There is plenty of parking on the side  which was nice, except don’t park in front Wednesdays 12-3p, you’ll get a ticket LOL. The dryer in the unit wouldn’t start one night and not only did Jake respond quickly, but had it working the next day. You have all the basics you need in the unit so you don’t need to bring much, especially if coming for a weekend. If I had to pick one negative is that you hear a lot from the other units. It wasn’t a huge problem as most abided by the quiet hours, but I was privy to a couple of late night conversations my last week there. It was such an inconvenience though that I booked the back apartment for my second stay ;)"

Lighting and sound system/entertainment center was modern and exciting for us to discover and use. Finally it was a pleasure to meet Tom on the  morning I was leaving. He was very charming. He made us a delicious cup of coffee and engaged us in friendly and interesting conversation. Would definitely love to stay there again.

We came into town to watch my son run his first marathon, and found the apt perfect for our needs.   Everything looks brand new as clearly recently remodeled, and centrally located for all our needs.  The rooms are spacious, and the four of us had plenty of space to spread out and relax.  The convenience and wine & spirit stores across the street came in very handy to walk across and grab a few forgotten items.  The host was quick to respond to a question I had, and the gas grill in the backyard was perfect for our post race celebration.  We will stay here again next time we come back to Albany."

The studio is in an excellent location, and is a steal for the space and convenience.  The beds are comfortable, the kitchen and bathrooms are very clean, and the rooms are climate controlled. For those who are light sleepers, we recommend headphones or ear plugs because the mornings can be bustling and the noise could disturb sleep. Enjoy Albany!"

Molly was always very friendly from beginning to the end, and extremely quick to respond to any question. The apartment is one bedroom, with a living room, a kitchen, and a bathroom. It has washer/dryer, and necessities like towels and dishes. It's very spacious, comfortable, and well-decorated. There is wifi. It was mostly quiet and a short walking distance to a lot of things in Albany. My stay couldn't have been more comfortable. "

Bathroom is not in the room but outside in the hallway- open to anyone in the facility to use as the basement dosent lock. Happy we meet the neighboring airbnb guest which made this experience much better!<br/>edit 2 weeks post trip- still have only been reimbursed $2 for the inconvenience.

I appreciate that the hosts were very attentive regarding the quietness and their constant communication. Washington Park is great for walking and taking photos along the bridge. There is a pretty lake as well. One thing to keep mind that there is not a general large supermarket in the area. The nearest ones were of not good quality and not very clean. It is in a good location 20 minutes walking distance from downtown. Perfect for a those who want to get to know Albany. I loved my stay and trip.

Otherwise, it was laid out well."

My cat came with me and had a blast running up and down the stairs. Diana was responsive and helpful! Very easy check-in. When my cat hid himself too well under the box spring she did everything she could to answer my calls and even have the building manager check the building to make sure he didn’t escape from the apartment. My only note is the neighborhood wouldn’t be my top choice as a solo female coming and going at very odd hours due to my job, but the building was very secure with multiple key pads and having a designated parking spot across the street definitely helped. Overall would definitely recommend! Perfect for long stays or even a weekend visit!"
10993,38321579,-628159645,2022-10-09,56770532,Marilda,Five stars isn’t enough. A gracious host who made us as welcome as old friends. Very accommodating and peaceful atmosphere. Came away feeling very smart for booking with Diana.

3706,13083497,769253872,2021-06-12,214652570,Bri,"CAUTION!! PLEASE READ BEFORE BOOKING!! Upon arrival i noticed that the back deck furniture was old and dirty. The couch that he shows where you can lay back on is DIRTY and RUSTED. Looks like it hasn’t been cleaned since he took those pictures as well as some of the furniture is replaced. There was white chairs and they both was dirty with brown,old rain water and leaves. When i brought it to the host attention he told me it was out of his control due to weather and told me i was overreacting and I should just “wipe it off and put a towel over the couch”. I understand that weather is out of someone’s control however those white chairs are as the only thing wet meaning it was like that sitting there for awhile. It wasn’t until I told him that I contacted Airbnb when he sent a housekeeper to wipe it off. Not actually clean it. Then he requires you to clean the either house SPOTLESS before leaving and does not provide any supplies. No mop. No broom. No pods for the dishwasher. I had to buy a broom myself. He doesn’t clean the blankets in the property after every guest. He has a sign on the refrigerator that says it’s cleaned only twice a month. Due to me contacting Airbnb he retaliated by telling Airbnb false allegations against me and also tried to charge me an extra $179 in cleaning fees which he never received. Once I explain to Airbnb the situation I was deemed a refund due to lack of HIS cleanliness. It is not family friendly. Would not recommend bring family or children."

13203,44265426,-157080129,2023-03-27,2353137,BilQis,"location, location, location. This Airbnb is simple, and it has significant character. The light shined through the windows and made the living room feel much bigger than its actual measurements. The apt is small enough to clean on your own (and there are plenty of cleaning products beneath the sink in the bathroom and kitchen, which was a plus for me) and big enough to entertain two or three more people comfortably. The neighborhood and park are absolutely gorgeous.  If you like history and architecture, then you will experience absolute bliss as you walk down the street. In addition, the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. This Airbnb, this neighborhood, and my interactions with Lloyd were a dream come true. I highly recommend this Airbnb and the neighborhood. Everyone who visited me raved about the character of the building and apt. Last, the apt is close to public transportation, the main restaurant and cultural hubs, and a major hospital and fire station (I didn't hear noise)."

We only stayed for a night as we had a late flight and had to leave in the morning, but Jason made sure we had everything we needed for our four-month old baby. We will definitely stay here again if we make our way back to Albany."

12759,44180048,-99745573,2021-08-10,64044741,Laura,"Honestly, I really just can't say enough good things about Lloyd's place on Washington Park. This will be the first place I look to the next time I'm in Albany. Lloyd's communication was excellent, his instructions were timely, clear and helpful. He has literally thought of everything. Have a question about something in the apartment? Lloyd is very likely to have already posted a small, tidy sign or note nearby to answer your questions. The check-in was very easy, and we loved the keypad lock (less to keep up with). I told my husband I could cheerfully live in this beautiful little studio apartment -- it's that good. Plus, the bed was literally the most comfortable I've ever slept on in an AirBnB. We were anxious about the street parking but we pulled right up and parked in front of the building at 6pm with no problem (can't guarantee that will be everyone's experience, but it sure worked for us). You cannot go wrong with this rental. Book with confidence!"

Crystal space is open, big beautiful kitchen with the best pots and pans and an amazing stove. She was very friendly and more than helpful and accommodating of any and all needs . The Neighborhood I wasn't excited about, but it is improving and Crystal place is NOT a reflection of the area! <br/>Thanks again, "

Only real negatives were that the only air conditioning unit was in the bedroom, there was no real way to cool down the living room ( it wasn’t extremely hot when I stayed thankfully) and they asked us to wash dishes prior to departure however there were no sponges to use. Oh and no paper towels anywhere! You can hear the neighbors  upstairs at night but wasn’t enough really to bother anyone. I’d recommend this place to just about anyone!"

17233,53567589,-330897414,2022-02-20,440787948,Robert,Brian is an excellent host! This was my first Airbnb experience. The home was just as advertised in the photos and description. Check-in instructions were provided upon booking and again prior to check-in time. The home was clean and had all necessary amenities. There was no noise from surrounding neighbors and street parking was relatively easy to find. The check-out process was as easy as locking the door. I highly recommend this location.

Not sure if the heat works since the electric radiator was offered. Comfortable bed and pillow.  Location is only 10 mins. Walk to capital and state st.

Though my stay was short, the host was really responsive to my messages. Towels and toiletries are there just in case you forget yours. The apartment was so big that it could easily fit 3-4 people. I particularly like the fact that I didn't have to share the bathroom with anyone.I think the place has a feel of being a cabin in the wood, which is unique for a place in Albany.  I highly recommend Earl's place if you happen to be in Albany."

The house was very nice and clean.<br/>There are three stories and each level has its own bathroom.  There were some issues with two of the bathrooms that were being worked on, but I was able to use the first floor bathroom, which worked out fine. The house was recently bought by Justin and Thomas, so they are still working on some things. Regardless, the house is comfortable, clean, and ready for house guests.<br/>In the morning, there were several coffees to choose from which was wonderful.<br/>Its' all I need to get my day started."

Check in was smooth and there were no issues with the street parking. The host was very responsive at all times. The unit smelled like gas the entire stay. She reassured us that the unit has been checked multiple times to confirm there was no gas leak and did offer to deliver candles to help with the smell.  There were tiny bugs on the bed and on the floor of the bed room. The bed was not comfortable. But the futon should not be considered an acceptable “bed” option. The frame joint runs thru the middle and it causes actual physical discomfort to lay on it.  There were beetles in the bathtub. Only two full size bath towels were provided for two people and a two night stay.  I understand the need for a cleaning fee but I felt $60 was excessive when the host also required that you leave the beds stripped and that you take out your own trash before check out.

The neighborhood is quiet and very walkable, with several great restaurants (and a wine shop) just a short walk away. Our dog really loved meeting new friends—canine and human—on her long walks, too. The house itself is cozy, comfortable, and well-equipped, making it a great place to stay in and relax or to use as a jumping off point to explore the Capital Region. We did both!"

18978,-138713049,303051193,2022-12-11,61514123,Nic,"Julia's place was fine. Not specular. Something was wrong with our shower valve which made for luke warm water, not fun. The biggest thing is the location. Yes, its somewhat close to restaurants and events, but I would say it is not walkable. It in a very sketchy area. For the money, I wouldn't recommend it. Stay at the Hampton Inn a few blocks away and truly walkable and the same cost."
7180,25549565,-1586089095,2023-07-19,526288301,Heather,"Was totally excited about this stay, was described fitting many more people than it could. Upon arrival we see the key is still in the door handle, immediately felt unsafe, two young females were the listed guests and we had two males helping move in, immediately the owner came downstairs which made this unit not private, and questioned why they were there and became angry at one using the key to open the door. There is only a curtain separating the suite from their house. No coffee left or sugar, hardly any shampoo or conditioner. The fan she blamed us on breaking was already broken which made the stay very hot. Not sure about the doorbell she brought up. Also, made my nephew and uncle feel very uncomfortable just for picking me up for work and stopping in. Not once did she say a word to me and we spoke several times during the stay. Besides the amazing area this was an awful stay. Upon checkout I cleaned the unit so well it was better than it was, and I have photos to prove it."

The building is old, so the unit itself has wear and tear to be expected, but it has been well kept and updated. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and are glad we chose to stay here! The building is super close to downtown (you could walk but we drove) and plenty to do. Beware of Albany's parking signs (even in front of this building)."

The host has thought of everything you might need, the house is old and beautiful.<br/>Lloyd was very friendly, always open to comments and very quick to respond to questions.<br/>The upstairs neighbors seem to be constantly rearranging their apartment, which was a bit annoying, but not tragic.<br/>The location is great for exploring pretty Albany.<br/>Absolutely recommend.

Plenty of space if working remotely. Chad and Kellie were great hosts; they were very responsive, often replying within minutes, the few times issues around the house came up. They also provided a lot of basic commodities (e.g., toilet paper, paper towels) throughout my entire stay. The house is walking distance to many restaurants, Washington park, and hospitals (AMC, VA hospital, CDPC). Although street parking is required for the house, I rarely had any difficulty finding space to park. I would definitely stay here again!"

If you’re not too picky with a place and you need a a place to stay before shifting somewhere else, this place and price is ideal considering the utilities you’re also getting. All the major streets are nearby meaning getting on the bus is convenient. One problem is that it’s not in the best neighborhood so expect a good amount of cat calling. If you’re a runner, run in the direction of western Ave and st rose college, didn’t experience weirdos in that direction."

The place is also a really good value for a two-week stay.  Parking was a little hard to find some nights close to the apartment, but usually parking could be found several blocks away.

The clawfoot tub and chandelier were unexpected and wonderful touches.  The entire decor is lovely and welcoming.  The house is very quiet and the neighborhood is just enough removed from the busy streets that you can get a good, full night's rest.  I was only there one night for my college reunion, but I shall definitely look to stay here again when I am back in town.

We had an absolutely wonderful time staying at the Buel House - perhaps our best ever experience in an airbnb or hotel!!! The heated pool was indeed warm and refreshing, and at 80 degrees plus it was surprisingly awesome to swim on a chilly April day (@ 45 degrees outside).  The living space was extremely luxurious, incredibly comfortable, and stylish - the modular sofa set up, the purple king bed mattress, many comfy pillows and high end touches were just marvelous. Highly highly recommend- book now!!!"

It was massive and gorgeous & has everything you need but it wasn’t cluttery feeling at all.<br/>-Super private. As a single female, I didn’t feel nervous or uncomfortable at all<br/>-Bathroom and shower were clean. Amazing water pressure—I could’ve spent hours in it. Oh and the shower itself has high ceilings too!<br/>-Lots of parking.

It would have been impossible to find anything else nearly this nice or convenient that allowed our pets. Everything is new, modern and clean. Anything you could possibly need in a pinch is there somewhere and if it’s not, Peter is always available to help. I especially appreciated the basement storage room, the 2 washer/dryer sets, the huge new fridge, all the big windows for my houseplants and the dog yard. My family appreciated the abundance of takeout food choices and the big bedroom TV’s. The gas fireplace is beautiful and so cozy! It couldn’t have been a better experience."

14600,48052353,-271450986,2021-08-22,7963317,Rob,"Clean, newly renovated apartment as represented with the pictures.  Safe neighborhood and located across the street from the security office of the local college.  Check in was a breeze.  Home had board games which we actually used!  Scott was an attentive and super responsive host, and accommodated our late check out request.  The reason for the three star review is that we visited in the summer on an 80 degree day, and the air conditioning set-up in the home is insufficient to cool the apartment.  The third bedroom never dropped below 78, and the kitchen was unable to receive any cold air from the living room AC unit.  This could be easily rectified with a few additional in-window AC units.  During our visit the apartment was cooled with two portable units with hoses.  One was in the living room and one was in one of the bedrooms.  If you plan to visit at a cooler time of year or have no need for the third bedroom, this home would be a five star air Bnb experience for the price."

I wasn’t there long enough to use the kitchen but it looked nice too.  Not much style in the decor so it has kind of a blah feel to it.  Also experienced a fair amount of street noise and downstairs noises.  Probably wouldn’t stay here again but it’s probably ok for the right traveler.

We took the advice of the listing and, after dinner at a place on Lark Street, had our glass of wine while touring the artwork in the halls, and it had quite a range. <br/>Back in the room, we lounged on the couch and enjoyed the view which included some of the Plaza lit up for the night.<br/>We had such a lovely time there for our 6th anniversary!<br/>Thank you so much!"

I got a bit confused with the lock (my own misreading of instructions) and these two were so responsive and patient. Their home is beautiful, and my dog and I felt so at home. I only stayed for a night, but will find a reason to go back. I absolutely fell in love with the loft apartment and pretty much everything about this AirBnB."

My partner and I went for a private getaway, wanting to just make nice dinners and enjoy the space; the kitchen was so we'll equipped I'm so glad I didn't bring my own things, the bathroom as well. The apartment was so fun and easy to relax in. Diana answered all of my questions upon arrival within minutes. I did not want to leave!"

We teleworked during the day and were able to spread out in the many spaces in the apartment and had no issues with the internet. The location was convenient - a short walk to downtown Albany and very easy access to the highway. We appreciated that Angela was very quick to respond when we needed some extra supplies during our stay.

The location is perfectly central while also being quiet and private. Everything you could need is just a short waking distance away. The apartment itself was very clean and comfortable! I hope we get a chance to come back to Albany soon so we can stay here again!

There's a big kitchen and a comfortable bed. The neighborhood isn't great, but there are nice shops and restarants in walking distance.

It is a very private and quiet apartment and I loved the off-street parking which is difficult to find in Albany. The apartment is located on the basement level of the home, but you also have access to the shared spaces upstairs which I enjoyed exploring as the house is an absolutely beautiful traditional colonial. Bela was available for any questions I had (and quickly arrived to help me when I locked myself out one day!!). The location of the home is perfect as it is central to everything (short drive to groceries, quick walk to the park, Starbucks, restaurants, etc.). I would recommend the Blair suite for short- or long-term stays!"

20416,1053640406,-1358409267,2023-07-09,334540939,Mia,"We stayed here for a convention at the MVP arena that was three days. Staying here helped cut down on driving an hour back and forth a couple of the days. It was walking distance from the arena which was great. The apartment was very nice and enough room for us. It is a small space but that’s okay for a short stay with 2 adults and 2 kids. We cooked in the kitchen and used the grill. The grill is about three flights down the porch stairs though but not a problem for me but something to be aware of. The only issue really was that the back porch was cute but it was dusty from pollen and it would have been nice if had been cleaned off. But overall that wasn’t a big deal at all. It was humid and the AC worked great and there was a fan too which I needed for the street noise at night. I’m a light sleeper! <br/>Overall we had a great stay. The kitchen had what we needed to cook. I like to clean up after myself though and there was no cleaning spray. Overall, loved it and would recommend."

Was much easier and convenient than private parking behind the building. I even locked myself out on my last night (locked bottom door handle on accident) and it was around 1 am (very inconvenient time in my opinion) and I felt soooo bad for asking them if they could unlock it and with NO PROBLEM OR HESITATION, her husband came right downstairs to unlock it for me. They live right upstairs and they gave me 100% privacy, would nvr know they live in the house above the basement apartment. I definitely recommend this listing!!

Some good features, but the bed was bad enough that I would not recommend staying here.<br/>The good: Price was right, location was close to the hospital (easy 10 minute walk), Chad was responsive to problems in the house, intelligently designed space for multiple guests to co-exist peacefully. The room is quite small, but it's manageable.<br/>The bad: I would describe the bed as a ""soft taco."" It felt like a soft foam pad with a trench down the middle. My wife and I rolled into one another all night long. I did not get a single good night of sleep in the 10 nights I spent here. We were both dying to leave after 3 nights."

But if you have a car, it's very hard to find parking and the area doesn't feel very safe as well. I was very nervous the two nights I left my car parked outside on the street. <br/>The apartment is located on the 2nd floor, and the stairs are very narrow and steep. So, if you have a big luggage, it could be a problem. We ended up leaving our big luggage inside the car because it was very hard to carry it upstairs. <br/>The apartment itself is spacious. The kitchen and living room are great. Every room has AC which was very nice. The bathroom is not the cleanest but it was tolerable. We found a dirty towel inside one of the closet in our bedroom, but we were able to find clean ones for us to use. Overall, it's an ok place to stay for a short period."

1583,9005989,133584229,2017-02-23,61996453,YooJin,"GREAT PLACE FOR BAR EXAM TAKERS. (in Feb & July)<br/>Sue's place is a perfect place to stay if you are taking the bar exam. Its really close to the exam site. Thankfully the weather was amazing while my stay so it wasn't cold as what other people had previously said in the review. But downside was kids running (upstairs). I didn't really mind because I was listening to music with my earphones throughout, but if you are looking for a quiet place to stay, not the best place.<br/>There is no parking but there are many public parking around the area.

Stay was clean and beds very comfortable. The place is super spacious and the zen area great for working out. Convenient street parking. Stocked with K cups!<br/>Bad- Several abandoned homes, demolition work nearby. Basement gets COLD in winter. Like, 'wearing my coat indoors' cold. Host dropped off a heater, but it did not help much, due to drafts coming from both ends of the apt. Shower was cold after 15 min of use. My friend woke up a few times at 3 am to what sounded like moving furniture upstairs. Last straw is we saw a mouse run under the oven with 1 week left of our stay. Host set mouse traps the next day. The traps attracted ants and my friend cleaned the floor multiple times. We were told an exterminator would be called but only after we moved out. We chose to leave 1 day early because of the mouse. We were given a 1 day refund, båut this was not offered, we had to ask."

Simple room in his home, but super comfortable bed, small desk and nice shared bathroom that you would only share with the owner, who was basically invisible during my stay. Parking is on the street, but there is no problem with that as it is not well-traveled. I had a Jag and was not concerned at all."

Not to mention the incredible back yard for any doggo to have enough play. Not too small and not too big with a lot of modern technology incorporated into the house. Easy to find street parking, on property parking was adventurous to find but Anthony’s right there to help you. With that said, Anthony’s quick responses was very much appreciated.

4708,20519453,466826028,2019-06-09,98039892,Samantha,"Michael and Flerida’s home was cleaned weekly on average and stocked with paper towels and toilet paper. My room was clean upon arrival and the house was as well. I stayed at this location for 16 weeks as I worked a travel assignment at St. Peter’s. The area was not the safest around but there is an ADT security system for those who choose to utilize it. On average, I felt that there were way too many people staying at this home as I was initially told there is typically 2-3 total. At times there were 7-8 which is very crowded for a two bathroom home. Parking in the driveway is first come, first serve and very difficult to park in with that many people staying in the house. Street parking is also very limited as there are other Airbnb’s across the street and an apartment complex. I had issues with guests being messy in the common areas, leaving the doors unlocked and taking food I purchased. As I understand that this is the hosts personal home, I felt that the host was not trusting of the guests and overbearing at times. The host would often show up at the house unannounced, even after I requested to be notified of “drop in’s.” This location was convenient for my commute, however, I felt an extended stay was very expensive for what you receive."

The apartment was easy to find and Jake provided clear instructions on how to gain access.  There was a bit of a bad odor upon entering the first door, probably due to the basement entrance being right there, but once I got into the apartment it wasn't so bad.  The space was perfectly cozy for our quick, one night stay.  Both the bed and the sleeper sofa were comfortable and plenty of nice towels, sheets and blankets were available.  We never watched the TV but we did use the heat because it was a chilly weekend.  We needed to head into town for some dinner but, not knowing the neighborhood very well, I wasn't sure where would be a good spot to take the girls.  I reached out to Jake and he quickly responded with a perfect recommendation.  I had a couple other questions throughout the evening and he was always quick to respond.  We were very happy with our stay here!"

It was no where near worth the price I paid. Not only that, the tub spout came off which I have never seen before. They said a lot stayed and no one complained, smells sus to me. Smells like a lie. Why? When he came he took a pic with the tub spout back on and sent it to me to be petty only for it to fall off again after he leaves LOL. A grown ass man tryna be petty. I have been to so many Airbnb’s and all types of hotels, this place is like a 1 star motel that treat you like shit and scams you to make it seem like they professional. Like come on do better. Not giving people a refund for your shitty service is so unprofessional and disgusting. Do better as a human. Or do you not have morals and ethics to treat others equally or was it because I’m Asian? Like bro grow tf up. Not your 5’6 bald ass tryna act tough at least grow some hair before you grow money. Anyways bye."

If you want to bring a heavy stuff like suitcase or strollers down to the room, it might be a work. The entrance of the house also has a few steps.<br/>The host let us park the  medium size stroller at 1F hallway near the stairs.<br/>Also, the bathroom was right next the room door, but we had to go through the (mostly private but) shared hallway, in case you privacy matters."

The bed and mattress are really comfortable -- amazing after having travelled all day on the train. The house is peaceful and quiet. The backyard, even at this time of year was sparkling with lights. This time, I met Georgie, one of the cats. He was friendly and quite beautiful (white and orange coat). I can be sensitive to cats but the space is so spotless that it was not an issue at all. We enjoyed the TV this time around and used the food prep area and all was great. Phat is a welcoming and gracious host. We'll stay here again when in Albany and would recommend it to anyone else who wants a great experience. I was with my kids, but this'd be ideal for a romantic couple's weekend."

20997,-359902887,619718030,2023-12-03,25972185,Kristina,"We chose this place because of the convenient location. The host was friendly and gave us clear and accurate instructions for how to check in. Upon arriving to the apartment and showering, we realized that although all the bath towels were clean, they had a strong smell of cigarettes. We got in for the night late and ready to go to sleep. We realized there was no comforter on the bed. We were cold, so we went to the linen closet to find a blanket. <br/>The one that was there was tattered with holes all over it. Not only that, but there were two very small, flat and old pillows on the bed and there were no extras to be found, making the sleeping experience uncomfortable. It felt disappointing to have paid to stay in a place that had not taken the comfort of their guests into consideration at all. For future stays, I recommend that this host upgrade their bedding and do their laundry in a place that is smoke free."

The bed was as comfy as advertised, the neighborhood lovely and peaceful, and all in all it was a great way to wind down after a long day of test taking in downtown Albany. Getting a room with Dan and Efrat was definitely the right decision -- far better than staying at some overpriced hotel downtown -- and I would recommend it to anyone in visiting the Albany area. I  regret only that I didn't have a bit more time to spend with my hosts. "

15682,51230498,2085496046,2023-04-16,69579272,Mathieu,"The apartment was great. Great value. everything is very clean and confortable. I have nothing bad to say  about the apartment itself. Still, people must know that this is a basement apartment without kitchen (there is a fridge and other items). And, the neighborhood is pretty noisy with cars blasting music early on Sunday mornings."
9938,33558235,500547610,2021-07-26,33436122,Victoria,"This place is decent, but it’s a just a bit old and in a not so great part of town. The bedding also smelled a bit. The apartment was spacious and it was fine for the price point. <br/>The only significant issue we had was regarding communication and access: after asking for a 1-hour extension for our check out and getting approval, Earl failed to mention that the code we were given for the outside of the building auto-expires after 2pm, and he didn’t warn us or tell us this, and we discovered it out the hard way. I am experienced with these kinds of locks and Airbnb experiences, and never usually have to contact the host about getting locked out because hosts usually have the foresight to get ahead of such things. There needs to be better preparation/communication/recognition of arranging for extending the entrance access code into the building if someone asks for a checkout even a minute past 2pm; it was pretty stressful to try to get back in, as we were on a time crunch to pack and get to our train. I tried to call twice initially, but someone picked up and did not say anything and I did not receive a call back, which was annoying (I had also called earlier in the weekend during our stay to ask a question about the TV, and he did the same thing - picked up the phone, I heard all this commotion and talking of several people in the background, but early did not say anything, so I was forced to hang up, tried calling again, and the same thing happened- pretty annoying and rude). I then messaged Earl on the Airbnb app, but at that point, it didn’t matter because luckily, the cleaning woman let us in, thank goodness. This was not a great way to handle this situation, hence the 4 stars (and the place could be cleaner…). <br/>It’s a good deal budget-wise, but a word of caution: it’s in a sketchy neighborhood. Lots of drug addicts/homeless loitering around at all hours. Also a scary situation that I’ve never encountered (and I live in NYC): a white man in a white minivan pulled up to us right outside of the Airbnb as we were waiting for our Uber with the passenger window down and showed off his AK47 military grade rifle by pointing it at us, then drove off quickly. Terrifying. We called the police to report it and messaged Earl about it too on Airbnb to give him a heads up (who knows if this was racially motivated, and this should NOT be taken lightly). I’m familiar with “bad” or unsafe parts of NYC, but none of that compares to the desolate neighborhood that this Airbnb is situated in…"

4929,20633175,405682695,2019-01-27,74218437,Michelle,Loved the food it was all organic and yummy. The apartment is cute and super clean.My boyfriend enjoyed the local beer. This place is very drafty because of it being a basement apartment with plenty of windows and a door outside next to the bed. The heat although we put it higher for it being 18 degrees out it did not stay on the whole night and was set weirdly to not stay on the level that was set. Got cold at night and had to wear a hoodie with several blankets even by the couch. This place is perfect for the spring or warmer months. I would love to see the outdoor garden when it’s not full of snow. James is very nice and helpful.

We got there a bit late but the lights had been switched out on for us and the check in process was very easy. Every space was very clean and cosy. The kitchen has everything you need, with there being plenty pots and pans cooking was very easy. There was no need to buy water because a water filter jug was given. The bedroom was a bit cold but there were extra blankets given so you didn’t really realize it, and the blackout blinds made sure no outside light came in at at night and the morning light wasn’t too much. The neighbourhoods great to walk around and felt very safe walking at night. There’s plenty do on the Main Street near by, with restaurants and a few small stores, but the apartment is far enough from them that your nights are not noisy and are calm. Overall we loved the place and would recommend to everyone."

Levy was a great host, the room was the perfect size and its only a 10 minute walk from buses that take you into the heart of downtown Albany. They even have their own home-brewed beer! Neighborhood is a sleepy one near the SUNY campus, good for long walks or a job if you were prefer. "

9926,33558235,-2137077988,2021-06-17,40306705,Kally,"This property was spacious and had a fun foosball table. There was some confusion about the parking--another guest from another unit was parked in the spot described as our spot, but I guess the host owns both. We wish that would have been more clear. Our primary issue with this apartment is that we could not get into it. The exterior door code was fine on check-in, but the code for the inside unit door was not working. I'm pretty experienced with these door locks at this point and I'm certain I was entering it correctly. The host was experiencing a personal issue at the time that made him unavailable when we were trying to check in. I called several times and emailed through the app. I tried calling his back-up, but the phone number wouldn't go through. I checked the messages in the app again, and after describing my problem, the back-up person simply restated the door code. Not helpful. We had the code already but it wasn't working. As we were leaving to find a hotel (and on hold with AirBnB headquarters), I tried the door once more and it finally worked. The host eventually called to describe why he was out-of-reach and it was a good reason, but he didn't have a good back-up person in place in our opinion. He said the door code issue was a known problem when the batteries begin to run low. He offered to come change them and I asked him just to let it be for the night since we were exhausted and had no plans to leave again until morning. The stay was pretty great on the inside and there were attempts by the host to make it cozy and efficient. Check out is at 2:00 p.m. and we left at 9:00. A sweatshirt was left behind so we turned around to go get it. When trying to reenter the exterior door, the code no longer worked. I again had to call the host. He came over thinking it was an interior door code problem--new batteries in tow. However, there is also a known problem with the exterior door code where the software updates and no longer syncs with check out times. He had to use his host code to get us back in the building. So this is the reason we gave a 4 instead of a 5. Being able to enter and exit the accommodation is pretty essential. Being able to reach the host or a back-up person who can actually help is essential. I rarely have to reach out to hosts at all during the stay, and for a one night stay I had to reach out to them a ton. Once you get into it, the place is pretty good. The host is actually incredibly kind and well-intentioned. We hope he can build his a team a bit and fix the door code issues so it's an easier stay for guests."

The Silk and Sun Room was a wonderful respite after busy days with family, and mornings and afternoons by the pool were lovely. Thank you Thomas and Justin for taking care of all the details (including Turkish linens and a really good hairdryer.)  ☺️"
17775,54150131,939636325,2023-05-22,374440629,Aree,"Jared went above and beyond to ensure our stay was comfortable. Communication was top notch and personable. By far this was the most comfy, cozy, and relaxing stay I have had in an AirBnb property. Honestly, the property felt like home and had personal touches (for me personally this is a big plus for assuaging travel anxiety). There were so many cool places to eat and be entertained within walking distance. I wish I could have taken the upstairs view back home with us! Lol. Nice juxtaposition of abundant nature (cute birds & squirrels! Hehe) mixed with statuesque imagery of downtown buildings. Saratoga Springs/Ballston Spa area is a relatively quick trip via highway. We were back and forth from Albany to Skidmore College and the AirBnb was a pleasant/relaxing end to our busy days. Jared was open to questions, welcoming of feedback/suggestions about the property, and we wished we could have stayed much, much longer!!"

985,6623339,207603185,2017-10-29,2013005,Sebastien,"Had a good time back in Albany at Terra's place. She was very responsive and attentive. The place was clean and is actually bigger than the photos had conveyed -- which was a nice surprise. There is ample storage and the bed was particularly comfy. The downside, as many have reported, is the noise coming from the street and the bar under the windows. This was, however, clearly communicated in the listing and by private messages before booking. Now this can't entirely be blamed on the location. I've owned a house in this very neighborhood for more than a decade before moving to Colorado, and it's a great place to be. The windows, however, are problematic, to the point where I wondered if they were actually wide open -- they weren't. Installing double-paned windows in the bedroom would make this listing an instant recommendation. Until then, I would suggest light-sleepers to look outside of Center Square, or bring a solid pair of ear plugs."

I stayed for one night and it was nice, however it did not help that it was stated that there was a functioning AC unit and when we arrived only to find out it apparently wasn’t “hooked up” in our room. So my girlfriend and I were sweating all night. Next we had no soap in the bathroom to wash our hands and only one towel to share between the two of us. The bed was comfortable. You couldn’t even open the windows. The one was stuck in place and the other you had to prop something under it in order to keep it open which only could keep a crack open. It kinda ruined our romantic night away so all in all it wasn’t the best stay. Again room was clean and put together, just wouldn’t stay here again."

2324,9501054,342231370,2018-10-28,32574264,Julie,"It is an old house which means imperfections but also a unique charm. I really enjoyed the antiquish feel and decor, especially the enormous bed. The room is large and  comfortable, with a desk and a working desk chair (which I really appreciate), an armchair, fridge, microwave. A twin bed as well as the big bed which is at least a queen, maybe a king.  Enough space that three friends could comfortably share it. TV only has a few channels and it's small, but hey I don't expect any TV at an inexpensive airbnb, it's a little bonus. If there was any drawback it was having no outlet close to the bed for phone charging; I bought a $10 extension cord for my stay. Bathroom down the hall is shared with another room but I never even saw the other guests. Bathroom clean with shampoo and lots of hot water. The guest rooms are on the ground floor, accessed under the front steps so there is privacy. Each room has a lockbox for easy check in. Some reviews noted there is stuff in the hallway and there is, but it's really not a big deal, it's just some shelves with random stuff on them, not massive clutter.  The location is easy walking distance from the convention center and arena, downtown and the capitol, though it is just on the other side of the expressway. There are boarded up buildings in the area and someone unaccustomed to an urban neighborhood might be uncomfortable but I never felt unsafe as a single woman, even walking back fairly late. There's a nice dive bar half a block down the hill, and a fun, cheap diner (Betty Boop's) a few blocks away. If I ever have reason to visit downtown Albany again I will absolutely book with Gregg again."

Great location, central to everything I needed, a bed to sleep in and amenities necessary to eat. This basement location is just what was pictured and exactly how Earl had described it. Earl was super responsive to all of my questions and concerns and always made me feel very comfortable. I had one small concern during my stay which was addressed by Earl almost immediately. I was a solo female traveler and I felt safe while at the location. If I am in need of another quick and affordable trip to Albany, I would definitely consider coming again."

It was less than 15 minutes away from most of the things we did around the area including eateries and bars. The house was extremely clean and I was so happy that there was a TV in the living room and the bedroom that were logged into streaming accounts.That really was amazing. <br/>One thing that I absolutely loved was how comfortable the bed and bedding were... it was incredible.  <br/>Another thing that I appreciated was the fact that Elsa was so responsive and kind when there was an incident with a shower curtain that fell while showering. She immediately sent someone to replace it and was able to provide bandaids and Neosporin. She was an amazing host. 5stars for else<br/>The only thing that I have a comment about is the windows didn’t have screens on it so if I want to open the window to The only thing that I have a comment about is the windows didn’t have screens on it so if I want to open the windows to get fresh air there were no screens and I was afraid that bugs were going to get in and they were a little difficult open and close but not impossible. <br/>I also wish the backyard was a little bit cleaner than what it was... <br/>I didn’t noticed that there was a pool in the backyard but I don’t think it’s open for the people for Airbnb..<br/>I would definitely  come here again!

We really appreciated being able to check in a little early so we could change before the wedding we were attending. He also took us on an awesome ATV tour of June Farms, and that made my boyfriend's whole trip ;)."

My girlfriend and I stayed here last weekend and she was very welcoming at the door after popping out of nowhere acting as if we were trying to interfere with her property not realizing that we were the guests. Not only that, at 9:30pm she makes a report to air bnb falsely accused us of breaking house rules intending to kick us out in the middle of the night. She tried to charge me $400 as damage to her tv knowing that it was already discolored and leaking ink. She claimed that we smashed her tv but little does she know we have proof of the state the tv was in when we arrived. The place was clean but had a musty and dusty odor to it. DON’T COME HERE!!!!"

The steps were uneven and cracked cement leading to the front door. <br/>The kitchen window is not in its frame and has a sealant and wires around it to keep it in place..that was unnerving. There is a huge gap from the glass to the frame, really strange.<br/>The teapot was rusty and there were no kitchen towels available for use. There was no detergent for the dish washer so we couldnt start dishes before we left.<br/>We were given 1 wash cloth and 3 towels for 3 adults for our stay. <br/>The rod in the bedroom closet was down-couldnt hang clothes. The electric sockets in the bedrooms werent usable, as one had all the internet cables attached to it and the other wasnt working. Had to move side tables away from bed to plug in lamps at night. <br/>Both beds were VERY comfortable!!<br/>Patio hadnt been swept and there was trash and overgrown weeds in the one pot.<br/>Cool space-dissappointed overall."

3075,10768745,2081518954,2023-10-21,82430190,Katy,"The studio was spacious and well-equipped. The vintage style is kind of fun but rather busy, and the space gets very little daylight so it can feel rather oppressive. The area is a pleasant, residential part of the city so felt nice and safe but (and this is my fault for not doing my research properly) not terribly convenient for travellers without their own transport. The nearest supermarket is about 25 minutes' walk away and there are very few cafes or shops close by. There are regular buses into the city centre, though, so for a short stay that wouldn't be such a problem. The host didn't really respond to messages which caused me some difficulties in planning my travel arrangements."

His place is on the lower level of his house, so you don't have to interrupt him while coming/going. The bed was cozy, and the shower pressure was on point! Just a small mess in the hallway, but it was probably just recent, and it didn't bother us too much. Definately looking forward to coming back."

Finding your place after 3 other Airbnb helped us to breathe and enjoy the time we had while there. Thank you for your kind notes left in the master bedroom and your thoughtfulness. The host was prompt and kind. I wish I would have found her place 1st. I would stay at her home again. The only thing I had to bring to her attention was the upstairs neighbors loud feet back and forth. She said she would address it. I highly recommend Diana’s place if your wanting the home feel!

The only unfortunate part of our stay was the smell of cigarette smoke in and around the bathroom. Allen explained to me it may have been previous tenants who broke the rules. <br/>I think it may have been from people next door, but even with that unfortunate part of our stay our host was proactive with providing us candles to hide the smell. He even messaged me that he will be painting the unit after we leave to further rid the smell. In summary, it was our host that made our stay enjoyable!"

I had everything I needed, and I was very pleased with the great location (walkable distance to the Albany Capital Center). <br/>Molly was super responsive and accommodating. I had some issue with checking in, as I couldn't open the door. Molly was so nice that she took a 40-minute drive just to come back and opened the door for me. <br/>Will definitely recommend Molly's place to anyone who plans to visit Albany."

4789,20519885,-2111785635,2021-07-14,85761932,Liz,"This is a very charming home, with some decent upgrades and thoughtful touches. The beds were comfortable, the entire place sparkling clean, and it was in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to Dunkin Donuts and Subway, and a short drive to so many other things. One thing to note is that floors in old homes creak. Our family is rather used to this, but for some others, getting up in the middle of the night is not a quiet affair and may take some getting used to. The stairways are also more narrow and steep, as is usual with older construction. The back stairway winds around more than many might be accustomed to, so be mindful of those who cannot navigate that easily. There is one small bedroom and full bath on the ground floor, which made the stairs a non-issue for the one in our party who couldn’t manage the stairs much. I cannot say enough great things about the hosts - they were very welcoming and easy to communicate with. We would stay there again next time we are in the area."

18162,-134757179,-793799332,2023-03-05,298841712,Gaurav,"A decent enough place with accommodations as described on the listing but beware what's ommitted from pictures or description. . . this is an apartment in a smelly old building in a sketchy part of town with inconvenient parking arrangement. There's evident water damage on the ceiling and the neighbors are noisy late into the night. You pay a $50 cleaning fee but have to remove all bedding and put in a hamper in the bathroom, take care of dishes, and trash. The beds are comfortable but the sofa is in bad shape and there are only two chairs. The bathroom is great - with a large jacuzzi tub, except for a loose toilet seat. Local hotels may be a more cost effective option for those who don't need as much space."
